0,The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.,en
1,"At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia), it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of a major planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and larger than any known dwarf planet.",en
2,"The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.",en
3,"It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field.",en
4,Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g); Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.,en
5,"Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides.",en
6,The Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days.,en
7,"During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar.",en
8,"The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period.",en
9,"That said, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through shifts in perspective due to libration.The most widely accepted origin explanation posits that the Moon formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth, out of the debris from a giant impact between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.",en
10,It then receded to a wider orbit because of tidal interaction with the Earth.,en
11,"The near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic maria (seas), which fill the spaces between bright ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact craters.",en
12,"Most of the large impact basins and mare surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, some three billion years ago.",en
13,"The lunar surface is relatively non-reflective, with a reflectance just slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt.",en
14,"However, because it has a large angular diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial object in the night sky.",en
15,"The Moon's apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse.",en
16,Both the Moon's prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of phases have provided cultural references and influences for human societies throughout history.,en
17,"Such influences can be found in language, calendar systems, art, and mythology.",en
18,The first artificial object to reach the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed spacecraft in 1959; this was followed by the first successful soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966.,en
19,"The only human lunar missions to date have been those of the United States' Apollo program, which landed twelve men on the surface between 1969 and 1972.",en
20,"These and later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that have been used to develop a detailed geological understanding of the Moon's origins, internal structure, and subsequent history.",en
21,"The usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply Moon, with a capital M. The noun moon is derived from Old English m≈çna, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic *mƒìn≈çn, which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *mƒìnsis month (from earlier *mƒìn≈çt, genitive *mƒìneses) which may be related to the verb measure (of time).Occasionally, the name Lunais used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish the Earth's moon from others, while in poetry Luna has been used to denote personification of the Moon.",en
22,"Cynthiais another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon personified as a goddess, while Selene(literally Moon) is the Greek goddess of the Moon.",en
23,"The usual English adjective pertaining to the Moon is lunar, derived from the Latin word for the Moon, l≈´na.",en
24,"The adjective selenian , derived from the Greek word for the Moon, œÉŒµŒªŒÆŒΩŒ∑ selƒìnƒì, and used to describe the Moon as a world rather than as an object in the sky, is rare, while its cognate selenic was originally a rare synonym but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium.",en
25,"The Greek word for the Moon does however provide us with the prefix seleno-, as in selenography, the study of the physical features of the Moon, as well as the element name selenium.The Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, Artemis, equated with the Roman Diana, one of whose symbols was the Moon and who was often regarded as the goddess of the Moon, was also called Cynthia, from her legendary birthplace on Mount Cynthus.",en
26,"These names ‚Äì Luna, Cynthia and Selene ‚Äì are reflected in technical terms for lunar orbits such as apolune, pericynthion and selenocentric.",en
27,"The astronomical symbol for the Moon is a crescent, , for example in M‚òæ 'lunar mass' (also ML).",en
28,Isotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System.,en
29,"Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed, but none satisfactorily explained the features of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system.",en
30,A fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth.,en
31,Gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon.,en
32,A co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon.,en
33,None of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system.,en
34,The prevailing theory is that the Earth‚ÄìMoon system formed after a giant impact of a Mars-sized body (named Theia) with the proto-Earth.,en
35,The impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and then the material accreted and formed the Moon just beyond the Earth's Roche limit of ~2.56 Rüú®.Giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System.,en
36,Computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the Earth‚ÄìMoon system.,en
37,"These simulations show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth.",en
38,"However, more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the proto-Earth.",en
39,"Other bodies of the inner Solar System such as Mars and Vesta have, according to meteorites from them, very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to Earth.",en
40,"However, Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions.",en
41,"The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.The impact released energy and then the released material re-accreted into the Earth‚ÄìMoon system.",en
42,"This would have melted the outer shell of Earth, and thus formed a magma ocean.",en
43,"Similarly, the newly formed Moon would have been affected and had its own lunar magma ocean; its depth is estimated from about 500 km (300 miles) to 1,737 km (1,079 miles).",en
44,"While the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence, some questions are still unresolved, most of which involve the Moon's composition.In 2001, a team at the Carnegie Institute of Washington reported the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks.",en
45,"The rocks from the Apollo program had the same isotopic signature as rocks from Earth, differing from almost all other bodies in the Solar System.",en
46,"This observation was unexpected, because most of the material that formed the Moon was thought to come from Theia and it was announced in 2007 that there was less than a 1% chance that Theia and Earth had identical isotopic signatures.",en
47,"Other Apollo lunar samples had in 2012 the same titanium isotopes composition as Earth, which conflicts with what is expected if the Moon formed far from Earth or is derived from Theia.",en
48,These discrepancies may be explained by variations of the giant-impact theory.,en
49,"For instance, a high-speed drive-by hit by the impactor allowed it to return to earth a second time but more slowly, and mix more thoroughly.",en
50,A hit-and-run-and-return scenario might be more likely.,en
51,"The Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30¬∞ from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins.",en
52,Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for.,en
53,"This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to adjust to its orbit.",en
54,The Moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium but has since departed from this condition.,en
55,"It has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core.",en
56,The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 kilometres (150 mi) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 kilometres (190 mi).,en
57,Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometres (310 mi).,en
58,"This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon's formation 4.5 billion years ago.Crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop.",en
59,"The final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.",en
60,"Consistent with this perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests a crust of mostly anorthosite.",en
61,"The Moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition, which is more iron-rich than that of Earth.",en
62,"The crust is on average about 50 kilometres (31 mi) thick.The Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.",en
63,"However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220 mi) or less, around 20% of the radius of the Moon.",en
64,"Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.",en
65,"The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5 GPa (49,000 atm).",en
66," Magnetic field The Moon has an external magnetic field of generally less than 0.2 nanoteslas, or less than one hundred thousandth that of Earth.",en
67,The Moon does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization likely acquired early in its history when a dynamo was still operating.,en
68,"However, early in its history, 4 billion years ago, its magnetic field strength was likely close to that of Earth today.",en
69,"This early dynamo field apparently expired by about one billion years ago, after the lunar core had completely crystallized.",en
70,"Theoretically, some of the remnant magnetization may originate from transient magnetic fields generated during large impacts through the expansion of plasma clouds.",en
71,These clouds are generated during large impacts in an ambient magnetic field.,en
72,This is supported by the location of the largest crustal magnetizations situated near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.,en
73, Gravitational field The gravitational field of the Moon has been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft.,en
74,"The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins.",en
75,The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon.,en
76,"There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.",en
77,The topography of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis.,en
78,"Its most extensive topographic feature is the giant far-side South Pole‚ÄìAitken basin, some 2,240 km (1,390 mi) in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System.",en
79,"At 13 km (8.1 mi) deep, its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon.",en
80,"The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole‚ÄìAitken basin.",en
81,"Other large impact basins such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims.",en
82,The far side of the lunar surface is on average about 1.9 km (1.2 mi) higher than that of the near side.The discovery of fault scarp cliffs suggest that the Moon has shrunk by about 90 metres (300 ft)within the past billion years.,en
83,Similar shrinkage features exist on Mercury.,en
84,"Mare Frigoris, a basin near the north pole long assumed to be geologically dead, has cracked and shifted.",en
85,"Since the Moon doesn't have tectonic plates, its tectonic activity is slow and cracks develop as it loses heat.",en
86," Volcanic features The dark and relatively featureless lunar plains, clearly seen with the naked eye, are called maria (Latin for seas; singular mare), as they were once believed to be filled with water; they are now known to be vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava.",en
87,"Although similar to terrestrial basalts, lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water.",en
88,The majority of these lava deposits erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins.,en
89,Several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side maria.,en
90,"Almost all maria are on the near side of the Moon, and cover 31% of the surface of the near side compared with 2% of the far side.",en
91,"This is likely due to a concentration of heat-producing elements under the crust on the near side, which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up, partially melt, rise to the surface and erupt.",en
92,"Most of the Moon's mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.0‚Äì3.5 billion years ago, although some radiometrically dated samples are as old as 4.2 billion years.",en
93,"As of 2003, crater counting studies of the youngest eruptions appeared to suggest they formed no earlier than 1.2 billion years ago.In 2006, a study of Ina, a tiny depression in Lacus Felicitatis, found jagged, relatively dust-free features that, because of the lack of erosion by infalling debris, appeared to be only 2 million years old.",en
94,Moonquakes and releases of gas indicate continued lunar activity.,en
95,"Evidence of recent lunar volcanism has been identified at 70 irregular mare patches, some less than 50 million years old.",en
96,"This raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed, at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer because of the greater concentration of radioactive elements.",en
97,"Evidence has been found for 2‚Äì10 million years old basaltic volcanism within the crater Lowell, inside the Orientale basin.",en
98,"Some combination of an initially hotter mantle and local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities on the far side in the Orientale basin.The lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called terrae, or more commonly highlands, because they are higher than most maria.",en
99,"They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean.",en
100,"In contrast to Earth, no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events.The concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moon's formation.",en
101,"Alternatively, it may be a consequence of asymmetrical tidal heating when the Moon was much closer to the Earth.",en
102," Impact craters A major geologic process that has affected the Moon's surface is impact cratering, with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface.",en
103,"There are estimated to be roughly 300,000 craters wider than 1 km (0.6 mi) on the Moon's near side.",en
104,"The lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events, including Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale; structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material, between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon.",en
105,"The lack of an atmosphere, weather, and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved.",en
106,"Although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated, they are useful for assigning relative ages.",en
107,"Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface.",en
108,"The radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the Apollo missions cluster between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years old: this has been used to propose a Late Heavy Bombardment period of increased impacts.Blanketed on top of the Moon's crust is a highly comminuted (broken into ever smaller particles) and impact gardened surface layer called regolith, formed by impact processes.",en
109,"The finer regolith, the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass, has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder.",en
110,The regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces: it varies in thickness from 10‚Äì20 km (6.2‚Äì12.4 mi) in the highlands and 3‚Äì5 km (1.9‚Äì3.1 mi) in the maria.,en
111,"Beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the megaregolith, a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometers thick.High-resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in the 2010s show a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than was previously estimated.",en
112,"A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimeters of regolith on a timescale of 81,000 years.",en
113,This rate is 100 times faster than the rate computed from models based solely on direct micrometeorite impacts.,en
114, Lunar swirls Lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moon's surface.,en
115,"They are characterized by a high albedo, appear optically immature (i.e.",en
116,"the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often have a sinuous shape.",en
117,Their shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls.,en
118,They are located in places with enhanced surface magnetic fields and many are located at the antipodal point of major impacts.,en
119,Well known swirls include the Reiner Gamma feature and Mare Ingenii.,en
120,"They are hypothesized to be areas that have been partially shielded from the solar wind, resulting in slower space weathering.",en
121, Presence of water Liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface.,en
122,"When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space.",en
123,"However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks, and hydrogen from solar wind, leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon.",en
124,"Computer simulations suggest that up to 14,000 km2 (5,400 sq mi) of the surface may be in permanent shadow.",en
125,"The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive.In years since, signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface.",en
126,"In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface.",en
127,"However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters.",en
128,"In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions.",en
129,"Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.The 2008 Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice, using the on-board Moon Mineralogy Mapper.",en
130,"The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl, in reflected sunlight, providing evidence of large quantities of water ice, on the lunar surface.",en
131,"The spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1,000 ppm.",en
132,"Using the mapper's reflectance spectra, indirect lighting of areas in shadow confirmed water ice within 20¬∞ latitude of both poles in 2018.",en
133,"In 2009, LCROSS sent a 2,300 kg (5,100 lb) impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater, and detected at least 100 kg (220 lb) of water in a plume of ejected material.",en
134,"Another examination of the LCROSS data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 ¬± 12 kg (342 ¬± 26 lb).In May 2011, 615‚Äì1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 was reported, the famous high-titanium orange glass soil of volcanic origin collected during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.",en
135,The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago.,en
136,This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth's upper mantle.,en
137,"Although of considerable selenological interest, this announcement affords little comfort to would-be lunar colonists ‚Äì the sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.",en
138,Analysis of the findings of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) revealed in August 2018 for the first time definitive evidence for water-ice on the lunar surface.,en
139,"The data revealed the distinct reflective signatures of water-ice, as opposed to dust and other reflective substances.",en
140,"The ice deposits were found on the North and South poles, although it is more abundant in the South, where water is trapped in permanently shadowed craters and crevices, allowing it to persist as ice on the surface since they are shielded from the sun.In October 2020, astronomers reported detecting molecular water on the sunlit surface of the Moon by several independent spacecraft, including the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).",en
141," The surface of the Moon is an extreme environment with temperatures that range from 140 ¬∞C down to ‚àí171 ¬∞C, an atmospheric pressure of 10‚àí10 Pa, and high levels of ionizing radiation from the Sun and cosmic rays.",en
142,The exposed surfaces of spacecraft are considered unlikely to harbor bacterial spores after just one lunar orbit.,en
143,"The surface gravity of the Moon is approximately 1.625 m/s2, about 16.6% that on Earth's surface or 0.166 …°.",en
144," Atmosphere The Moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum, with a total mass of less than 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons).",en
145,The surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 √ó 10‚àí15 atm (0.3 nPa); it varies with the lunar day.,en
146,"Its sources include outgassing and sputtering, a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions.",en
147,"Elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium, produced by sputtering (also found in the atmospheres of Mercury and Io); helium-4 and neon from the solar wind; and argon-40, radon-222, and polonium-210, outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle.",en
148,"The absence of such neutral species (atoms or molecules) as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and magnesium, which are present in the regolith, is not understood.",en
149,"Water vapor has been detected by Chandrayaan-1 and found to vary with latitude, with a maximum at ~60‚Äì70 degrees; it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith.",en
150,"These gases either return into the regolith because of the Moon's gravity or are lost to space, either through solar radiation pressure or, if they are ionized, by being swept away by the solar wind's magnetic field.Studies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions demonstrate that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago.",en
151,"This atmosphere, sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions, was twice the thickness of that of present-day Mars.",en
152,The ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space.,en
153," DustA permanent Moon dust cloud exists around the Moon, generated by small particles from comets.",en
154,"Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface every 24 hours, resulting in the ejection of dust particles.",en
155,"The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall.",en
156,"On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising up to 100 kilometers above the surface.",en
157,"Dust counts made by LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX) found particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon pass through comet debris.",en
158,"The lunar dust cloud is asymmetric, being more dense near the boundary between the Moon's dayside and nightside.",en
159,"The Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons.",en
160,"It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto.",en
161,"While the minor-planet moon Charon of the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto, the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets.The Moon's diameter is about 3,500 km, more than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of Australia.",en
162,"The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers, slightly less than the area of the Americas (North and South America).",en
163,"The Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's, being the second densest among the planetary moons, having the second highest surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654 g and an escape velocity of 2.38 km/s (8600 km/h; 5300 mph).",en
164,"Because of tidal locking, the rotation of the Moon around its own axis is synchronous to its orbital period around the Earth.",en
165,"The Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars about once every 27.3 days, its sidereal period.",en
166,"However, because Earth is moving in its orbit around the Sun at the same time, it takes slightly longer for the Moon to show the same phase to Earth, which is about 29.5 days; its synodic period.Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon orbits closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane.",en
167,"The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways.",en
168,"For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years, which affects other aspects of lunar motion.",en
169,"These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.The Moon's axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 1.5427¬∞, much less than the 23.44¬∞ of Earth.",en
170,"Because of this, the Moon's solar illumination varies much less with season, and topographical details play a crucial role in seasonal effects.",en
171,"From images taken by Clementine in 1994, it appears that four mountainous regions on the rim of the crater Peary at the Moon's north pole may remain illuminated for the entire lunar day, creating peaks of eternal light.",en
172,No such regions exist at the south pole.,en
173,"Similarly, there are places that remain in permanent shadow at the bottoms of many polar craters, and these craters of eternal darkness are extremely cold: Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at 35 K (‚àí238 ¬∞C; ‚àí397 ¬∞F) and just 26 K (‚àí247 ¬∞C; ‚àí413 ¬∞F) close to the winter solstice in the north polar crater Hermite.",en
174,"This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a spacecraft, colder even than the surface of Pluto.",en
175,"Average temperatures of the Moon's surface are reported, but temperatures of different areas will vary greatly depending upon whether they are in sunlight or shadow.",en
176,"The Earth and the Moon's barycentre, their common center of mass, is located 1,700 km (1,100 mi) (about a quarter of Earth's radius) beneath the Earth's surface.",en
177,"The Earth revolves around the Earth-Moon barycentre once a sidereal month, with 1/81 the speed of the Moon, or about 12.5 metres (41 ft) per second.",en
178,This motion is superimposed on the much larger revolution of the Earth around the Sun at a speed of about 30 kilometres (19 mi) per second.,en
179,The gravitational attraction that masses have for one another decreases inversely with the square of the distance of those masses from each other.,en
180,"As a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in tidal forces.",en
181,Tidal forces affect both the Earth's crust and oceans.,en
182,"The most obvious effect of tidal forces is to cause two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite.",en
183,This results in elevated sea levels called ocean tides.,en
184,"As the Earth rotates on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place under the Moon, while another such tide is opposite.",en
185,"As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.",en
186,"Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth.",en
187,"The Sun has the same tidal effect on the Earth, but its forces of attraction are only 40% that of the Moon's; the Sun's and Moon's interplay is responsible for spring and neap tides.",en
188,"If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects: the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors, the inertia of water's movement, ocean basins that grow shallower near land, the sloshing of water between different ocean basins.",en
189,"As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.",en
190,"While gravitation causes acceleration and movement of the Earth's fluid oceans, gravitational coupling between the Moon and Earth's solid body is mostly elastic and plastic.",en
191,The result is a further tidal effect of the Moon on the Earth that causes a bulge of the solid portion of the Earth nearest the Moon.,en
192,Delays in the tidal peaks of both ocean and solid-body tides cause torque in opposition to the Earth's rotation.,en
193,"This drains angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from Earth's rotation, slowing the Earth's rotation.",en
194,"That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process (confusingly known as tidal acceleration), which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit and results in its lower orbital speed about the Earth.",en
195,"Thus the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing, and the Earth's rotation is slowing in reaction.",en
196,Measurements from laser reflectors left during the Apollo missions (lunar ranging experiments) have found that the Moon's distance increases by 38 mm (1.5 in) per year (roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow).,en
197,"Atomic clocks show that Earth's day lengthens by about 17 microseconds every year, slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds.",en
198,"This tidal drag would continue until the rotation of Earth and the orbital period of the Moon matched, creating mutual tidal locking between the two and suspending the Moon over one meridian (this is currently the case with Pluto and its moon Charon).",en
199,"However, the Sun will become a red giant engulfing the Earth-Moon system long before this occurrence.In a like manner, the lunar surface experiences tides of around 10 cm (4 in) amplitude over 27 days, with three components: a fixed one due to Earth, because they are in synchronous rotation, a variable tide due to orbital eccentricity and inclination, and a small varying component from the Sun.",en
200,"The Earth-induced variable component arises from changing distance and libration, a result of the Moon's orbital eccentricity and inclination (if the Moon's orbit were perfectly circular and un-inclined, there would only be solar tides).",en
201,"Libration changes the angle from which the Moon is seen, allowing a total of about 59% of its surface to be seen from Earth over time.",en
202,The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes.,en
203,"Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes, although moonquakes can last for up to an hour ‚Äì significantly longer than terrestrial quakes ‚Äì because of scattering of the seismic vibrations in the dry fragmented upper crust.",en
204,"The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972.According to recent research, scientists suggest that the Moon's influence on the Earth may contribute to maintaining Earth's magnetic field.",en
205,The synchronous rotation of the Moon as it orbits the Earth results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards the planet.,en
206,"However, because of the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.",en
207,"The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side, and the opposite the far side.",en
208,"The far side is often inaccurately called the dark side, but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once every 29.5 Earth days.",en
209,"During new moon, the near side is dark.The Moon originally rotated at a faster rate, but early in its history its rotation slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by Earth.",en
210,"With time, the energy of rotation of the Moon on its axis was dissipated as heat, until there was no rotation of the Moon relative to Earth.",en
211,"In 2016, planetary scientists using data collected on the 1998-99 NASA Lunar Prospector mission, found two hydrogen-rich areas (most likely former water ice) on opposite sides of the Moon.",en
212,It is speculated that these patches were the poles of the Moon billions of years ago before it was tidally locked to Earth.,en
213,"The Moon has an exceptionally low albedo, giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt.",en
214,"Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun.",en
215,"This is due partly to the brightness enhancement of the opposition surge; the Moon at quarter phase is only one-tenth as bright, rather than half as bright, as at full moon.",en
216,"Additionally, color constancy in the visual system recalibrates the relations between the colors of an object and its surroundings, and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark, the sunlit Moon is perceived as a bright object.",en
217,"The edges of the full moon seem as bright as the center, without limb darkening, because of the reflective properties of lunar soil, which retroreflects light more towards the Sun than in other directions.",en
218,"The Moon does appear larger when close to the horizon, but this is a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, first described in the 7th century BC.",en
219,"The full Moon's angular diameter is about 0.52¬∞ (on average) in the sky, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see ¬ß Eclipses).",en
220,The Moon's highest altitude at culmination varies by its phase and time of year.,en
221,The full moon is highest in the sky during winter (for each hemisphere).,en
222,The orientation of the Moon's crescent depends on the latitude of the viewing location; an observer in the tropics can see a smile-shaped crescent Moon.,en
223,The Moon is visible for two weeks every draconic month (27.2 days) at the North and South Poles.,en
224,Zooplankton in the Arctic use moonlight when the Sun is below the horizon for months on end.,en
225,The orientation of the Moon depends on the hemisphere of the Earth from which it is being viewed.,en
226,In the northern hemisphere it is seen upside down compared to the view in the southern hemisphere.,en
227,"The distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356,400 km (221,500 mi) to 406,700 km (252,700 mi) at perigee (closest) and apogee (farthest), respectively.",en
228,"On 14 November 2016, it was closer to Earth when at full phase than it has been since 1948, 14% closer than its farthest position in apogee.",en
229,"Reported as a supermoon, this closest point coincided within an hour of a full moon, and it was 30% more luminous than when at its greatest distance because its angular diameter is 14% greater and 1.142 ‚âà 1.30\approx 1.30} .",en
230,"At lower levels, the human perception of reduced brightness as a percentage is provided by the following formula:perceived reduction% = 100 √óactual reduction%100\%=100\times \% \over 100}}} When the actual reduction is 1.00 / 1.30, or about 0.770, the perceived reduction is about 0.877, or 1.00 / 1.14.",en
231,This gives a maximum perceived increase of 14% between apogee and perigee moons of the same phase.There has been historical controversy over whether features on the Moon's surface change over time.,en
232,"Today, many of these claims are thought to be illusory, resulting from observation under different lighting conditions, poor astronomical seeing, or inadequate drawings.",en
233,"However, outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena.",en
234,"Recently, it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km (1.9 mi) diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago.The Moon's appearance, like the Sun's, can be affected by Earth's atmosphere.",en
235,"Common optical effects are the 22¬∞ halo ring, formed when the Moon's light is refracted through the ice crystals of high cirrostratus clouds, and smaller coronal rings when the Moon is seen through thin clouds.",en
236,"The illuminated area of the visible sphere (degree of illumination) is given by ( 1 ‚àí cos ‚Å° e )/2 =sin2 ‚Å° ( e/2 ) (e/2)} , where e is the elongation (i.e., the angle between Moon, the observer on Earth, and the Sun).",en
237," Eclipses Eclipses only occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in a straight line (termed syzygy).",en
238,"Solar eclipses occur at new moon, when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth.",en
239,"In contrast, lunar eclipses occur at full moon, when Earth is between the Sun and Moon.",en
240,"The apparent size of the Moon is roughly the same as that of the Sun, with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide.",en
241,The Sun is much larger than the Moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller Moon from the perspective of Earth.,en
242,"The variations in apparent size, due to the non-circular orbits, are nearly the same as well, though occurring in different cycles.",en
243,This makes possible both total (with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun) and annular (with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun) solar eclipses.,en
244,"In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye.",en
245,"Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time, the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing.",en
246,"As it evolves toward becoming a red giant, the size of the Sun, and its apparent diameter in the sky, are slowly increasing.",en
247,"The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses, and no annular eclipses were possible.",en
248,"Likewise, hundreds of millions of years in the future, the Moon will no longer cover the Sun completely, and total solar eclipses will not occur.Because the Moon's orbit around Earth is inclined by about 5.145¬∞ (5¬∞ 9') to the orbit of Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon.",en
249,"For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes.",en
250,"The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18 years.Because the Moon continuously blocks the view of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view.",en
251,"In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun.",en
252,"Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time.",en

485,"Over the past 4.6 billion years, the amount of helium and its location within the Sun has gradually changed.",en
486,"Within the core, the proportion of helium has increased from about 24% to about 60% due to fusion, and some of the helium and heavy elements have settled from the photosphere towards the center of the Sun because of gravity.",en
487,The proportions of metals (heavier elements) is unchanged.,en
488,"Heat is transferred outward from the Sun's core by radiation rather than by convection (see Radiative zone below), so the fusion products are not lifted outward by heat; they remain in the core and gradually an inner core of helium has begun to form that cannot be fused because presently the Sun's core is not hot or dense enough to fuse helium.",en
489,"In the current photosphere, the helium fraction is reduced, and the metallicity is only 84% of what it was in the protostellar phase (before nuclear fusion in the core started).",en
490,"In the future, helium will continue to accumulate in the core, and in about 5 billion years this gradual build-up will eventually cause the Sun to exit the main sequence and become a red giant.The chemical composition of the photosphere is normally considered representative of the composition of the primordial Solar System.",en
491,The solar heavy-element abundances described above are typically measured both using spectroscopy of the Sun's photosphere and by measuring abundances in meteorites that have never been heated to melting temperatures.,en
492,These meteorites are thought to retain the composition of the protostellar Sun and are thus not affected by the settling of heavy elements.,en
493,The two methods generally agree well.,en
494," In the 1970s, much research focused on the abundances of iron-group elements in the Sun.",en
495,"Although significant research was done, until 1978 it was difficult to determine the abundances of some iron-group elements (e.g.",en

514,"Through most of the Sun's life, energy has been produced by nuclear fusion in the core region through a series of nuclear reactions called the p‚Äìp (proton‚Äìproton) chain; this process converts hydrogen into helium.",en
515,"Only 0.8% of the energy generated in the Sun comes from another sequence of fusion reactions called the CNO cycle, though this proportion is expected to increase as the Sun becomes older.The core is the only region in the Sun that produces an appreciable amount of thermal energy through fusion; 99% of the power is generated within 24% of the Sun's radius, and by 30% of the radius, fusion has stopped nearly entirely.",en
516,"The remainder of the Sun is heated by this energy as it is transferred outwards through many successive layers, finally to the solar photosphere where it escapes into space through radiation (photons) or advection (massive particles).The proton‚Äìproton chain occurs around 9.2√ó1037 times each second in the core, converting about 3.7√ó1038 protons into alpha particles (helium nuclei) every second (out of a total of ~8.9√ó1056 free protons in the Sun), or about 6.2√ó1011 kg/s.",en
517,"Fusing four free protons (hydrogen nuclei) into a single alpha particle (helium nucleus) releases around 0.7% of the fused mass as energy, so the Sun releases energy at the mass‚Äìenergy conversion rate of 4.26 million metric tons per second (which requires 600 metric megatons of hydrogen), for 384.6 yottawatts (3.846√ó1026 W), or 9.192√ó1010 megatons of TNT per second.",en
518,"The large power output of the Sun is mainly due to the huge size and density of its core (compared to Earth and objects on Earth), with only a fairly small amount of power being generated per cubic metre.",en
519,"Theoretical models of the Sun's interior indicate a maximum power density, or energy production, of approximately 276.5 watts per cubic metre at the center of the core, which is about the same power density inside a compost pile.The fusion rate in the core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more and expand slightly against the weight of the outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; and a slightly lower rate would cause the core to cool and shrink slightly, increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.",en
520,"From the core out to about 0.7 solar radii, thermal radiation is the primary means of energy transfer.",en
521,The temperature drops from approximately 7 million to 2 million kelvins with increasing distance from the core.,en
522,"This temperature gradient is less than the value of the adiabatic lapse rate and hence cannot drive convection, which explains why the transfer of energy through this zone is by radiation instead of thermal convection.",en
523,"Ions of hydrogen and helium emit photons, which travel only a brief distance before being reabsorbed by other ions.",en
524,"The density drops a hundredfold (from 20 g/cm3 to 0.2 g/cm3) between 0.25 solar radii and 0.7 radii, the top of the radiative zone.",en

529,"In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or hot enough to transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation.",en
530,"Instead, the density of the plasma is low enough to allow convective currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface.",en
531,"Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise.",en
532,"As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above.",en
533,"Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks to the base of the convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the convective cycle continues.",en
534,"At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/10,000 the density of air at sea level).The thermal columns of the convection zone form an imprint on the surface of the Sun giving it a granular appearance called the solar granulation at the smallest scale and supergranulation at larger scales.",en

541,"The photosphere is tens to hundreds of kilometers thick, and is slightly less opaque than air on Earth.",en

543,"The spectrum of sunlight has approximately the spectrum of a black-body radiating at 5,777 K (5,504 ¬∞C; 9,939 ¬∞F), interspersed with atomic absorption lines from the tenuous layers above the photosphere.",en
544,The photosphere has a particle density of ~1023 m‚àí3 (about 0.37% of the particle number per volume of Earth's atmosphere at sea level).,en
545,"The photosphere is not fully ionized‚Äîthe extent of ionization is about 3%, leaving almost all of the hydrogen in atomic form.During early studies of the optical spectrum of the photosphere, some absorption lines were found that did not correspond to any chemical elements then known on Earth.",en
546,"In 1868, Norman Lockyer hypothesized that these absorption lines were caused by a new element that he dubbed helium, after the Greek Sun god Helios.",en
547,"Twenty-five years later, helium was isolated on Earth.",en
548,"During a total solar eclipse, when the disk of the Sun is covered by that of the Moon, parts of the Sun's surrounding atmosphere can be seen.",en
549,"It is composed of four distinct parts: the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona and the heliosphere.",en
550,"The coolest layer of the Sun is a temperature minimum region extending to about 500 km above the photosphere, and has a temperature of about 4,100 K. This part of the Sun is cool enough to allow the existence of simple molecules such as carbon monoxide and water, which can be detected via their absorption spectra.The chromosphere, transition region, and corona are much hotter than the surface of the Sun.",en
551,"The reason is not well understood, but evidence suggests that Alfv√©n waves may have enough energy to heat the corona.Above the temperature minimum layer is a layer about 2,000 km thick, dominated by a spectrum of emission and absorption lines.",en
552,"It is called the chromosphere from the Greek root chroma, meaning color, because the chromosphere is visible as a colored flash at the beginning and end of total solar eclipses.",en
553,"The temperature of the chromosphere increases gradually with altitude, ranging up to around 20,000 K near the top.",en
554,In the upper part of the chromosphere helium becomes partially ionized.,en
555,"Above the chromosphere, in a thin (about 200 km) transition region, the temperature rises rapidly from around 20,000 K in the upper chromosphere to coronal temperatures closer to 1,000,000 K. The temperature increase is facilitated by the full ionization of helium in the transition region, which significantly reduces radiative cooling of the plasma.",en
556,The transition region does not occur at a well-defined altitude.,en
557,"Rather, it forms a kind of nimbus around chromospheric features such as spicules and filaments, and is in constant, chaotic motion.",en
558,"The transition region is not easily visible from Earth's surface, but is readily observable from space by instruments sensitive to the extreme ultraviolet portion of the spectrum.The corona is the next layer of the Sun.",en
559,"The low corona, near the surface of the Sun, has a particle density around 1015 m‚àí3 to 1016 m‚àí3.",en
560,"The average temperature of the corona and solar wind is about 1,000,000‚Äì2,000,000 K; however, in the hottest regions it is 8,000,000‚Äì20,000,000 K. Although no complete theory yet exists to account for the temperature of the corona, at least some of its heat is known to be from magnetic reconnection.",en
561,"The corona is the extended atmosphere of the Sun, which has a volume much larger than the volume enclosed by the Sun's photosphere.",en
562,"A flow of plasma outward from the Sun into interplanetary space is the solar wind.The heliosphere, the tenuous outermost atmosphere of the Sun, is filled with the solar wind plasma.",en
563,"This outermost layer of the Sun is defined to begin at the distance where the flow of the solar wind becomes superalfv√©nic‚Äîthat is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfv√©n waves, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU).",en
564,"Turbulence and dynamic forces in the heliosphere cannot affect the shape of the solar corona within, because the information can only travel at the speed of Alfv√©n waves.",en
565,"The solar wind travels outward continuously through the heliosphere, forming the solar magnetic field into a spiral shape, until it impacts the heliopause more than 50 AU from the Sun.",en
566,"In December 2004, the Voyager 1 probe passed through a shock front that is thought to be part of the heliopause.",en
567,"In late 2012 Voyager 1 recorded a marked increase in cosmic ray collisions and a sharp drop in lower energy particles from the solar wind, which suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause and entered the interstellar medium, and indeed did so August 25, 2012 at approximately 122 astronomical units from the Sun.",en
568,The heliosphere has a heliotail which stretches out behind it due to the Sun's movement.,en
569,"High-energy gamma ray photons initially released with fusion reactions in the core are almost immediately absorbed by the solar plasma of the radiative zone, usually after traveling only a few millimeters.",en
570,Re-emission happens in a random direction and usually at slightly lower energy.,en

572,"Estimates of the photon travel time range between 10,000 and 170,000 years.",en
573,"In contrast, it takes only 2.3 seconds for the neutrinos, which account for about 2% of the total energy production of the Sun, to reach the surface.",en
574,"Because energy transport in the Sun is a process that involves photons in thermodynamic equilibrium with matter, the time scale of energy transport in the Sun is longer, on the order of 30,000,000 years.",en
575,"This is the time it would take the Sun to return to a stable state if the rate of energy generation in its core were suddenly changed.Neutrinos are also released by the fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately.",en
576,For many years measurements of the number of neutrinos produced in the Sun were lower than theories predicted by a factor of 3.,en
577,"This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of neutrino oscillation: the Sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing 2‚ÅÑ3 of them because the neutrinos had changed flavor by the time they were detected.",en
578, The Sun has a magnetic field that varies across its surface.,en
579,"Its polar field is 1‚Äì2 gauss (0.0001‚Äì0.0002 T), whereas the field is typically 3,000 gauss (0.3 T) in features on the Sun called sunspots and 10‚Äì100 gauss (0.001‚Äì0.01 T) in solar prominences.",en
580,The magnetic field varies in time and location.,en
581,The quasi-periodic 11-year solar cycle is the most prominent variation in which the number and size of sunspots waxes and wanes.Sunspots are visible as dark patches on the Sun's photosphere and correspond to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface.,en
582,"As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, so they appear dark.",en
583,"At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none can be seen at all.",en
584,Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes.,en
585,"As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend to form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Sp√∂rer's law.",en
586,"The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.An 11-year sunspot cycle is half of a 22-year Babcock‚ÄìLeighton dynamo cycle, which corresponds to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields.",en
587,"At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength.",en
588,"At this point in the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of the toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east‚Äìwest and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities.",en
589,"The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.During the solar cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the internal toroidal magnetic field to the external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size.",en
590,"At solar-cycle minimum, the toroidal field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength.",en
591,"With the rise of the next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the toroidal field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle.",en
592,"The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.The solar magnetic field extends well beyond the Sun itself.",en
593,"The electrically conducting solar wind plasma carries the Sun's magnetic field into space, forming what is called the interplanetary magnetic field.",en
594,"In an approximation known as ideal magnetohydrodynamics, plasma particles only move along the magnetic field lines.",en
595,"As a result, the outward-flowing solar wind stretches the interplanetary magnetic field outward, forcing it into a roughly radial structure.",en
596,"For a simple dipolar solar magnetic field, with opposite hemispherical polarities on either side of the solar magnetic equator, a thin current sheet is formed in the solar wind.",en
597,"At great distances, the rotation of the Sun twists the dipolar magnetic field and corresponding current sheet into an Archimedean spiral structure called the Parker spiral.",en
598,The interplanetary magnetic field is much stronger than the dipole component of the solar magnetic field.,en
599,"The Sun's dipole magnetic field of 50‚Äì400 ŒºT (at the photosphere) reduces with the inverse-cube of the distance, leading to a predicted magnetic field of 0.1 nT at the distance of Earth.",en
600,"However, according to spacecraft observations the interplanetary field at Earth's location is around 5 nT, about a hundred times greater.",en
601,The difference is due to magnetic fields generated by electrical currents in the plasma surrounding the Sun.,en
602,The Sun's magnetic field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity.,en
603,Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups.,en
604,Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface.,en
605,Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary magnetic field outward into the Solar System.,en
606,The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and the disruption of radio communications and electric power.,en
607,Solar activity is thought to have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.,en
608,"With solar-cycle modulation of sunspot number comes a corresponding modulation of space weather conditions, including those surrounding Earth where technological systems can be affected.",en
609,"In December 2019, a new type of solar magnetic explosion was observed, known as forced magnetic reconnection.",en
610,"Previously, in a process called spontaneous magnetic reconnection, it was observed that the solar magnetic field lines diverge explosively and then converge again instantaneously.",en
611,"Forced Magnetic Reconnection was similar, but it was triggered by an explosion in the corona.",en
612," Long-term secular change in sunspot number is thought, by some scientists, to be correlated with long-term change in solar irradiance, which, in turn, might influence Earth's long-term climate.",en
613,"For example, in the 17th century, the solar cycle appeared to have stopped entirely for several decades; few sunspots were observed during a period known as the Maunder minimum.",en
614,"This coincided in time with the era of the Little Ice Age, when Europe experienced unusually cold temperatures.",en
615,"Earlier extended minima have been discovered through analysis of tree rings and appear to have coincided with lower-than-average global temperatures.A recent theory claims that there are magnetic instabilities in the core of the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years.",en
616,These could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the Milankovitch cycles.,en
617,The Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life.,en
618,It has not changed dramatically for over four billion years and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more.,en
619,"However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo dramatic changes, both internally and externally.",en
620, The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of part of a giant molecular cloud that consisted mostly of hydrogen and helium and that probably gave birth to many other stars.,en
621,This age is estimated using computer models of stellar evolution and through nucleocosmochronology.,en
622,"The result is consistent with the radiometric date of the oldest Solar System material, at 4.567 billion years ago.",en
623,"Studies of ancient meteorites reveal traces of stable daughter nuclei of short-lived isotopes, such as iron-60, that form only in exploding, short-lived stars.",en
624,This indicates that one or more supernovae must have occurred near the location where the Sun formed.,en
625,A shock wave from a nearby supernova would have triggered the formation of the Sun by compressing the matter within the molecular cloud and causing certain regions to collapse under their own gravity.,en
626,As one fragment of the cloud collapsed it also began to rotate due to conservation of angular momentum and heat up with the increasing pressure.,en
627,"Much of the mass became concentrated in the center, whereas the rest flattened out into a disk that would become the planets and other Solar System bodies.",en
628,"Gravity and pressure within the core of the cloud generated a lot of heat as it accumulated more matter from the surrounding disk, eventually triggering nuclear fusion.",en
629,"HD 162826 and HD 186302 are hypothesized stellar siblings of the Sun, having formed in the same molecular cloud.",en
630,"The Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium.",en
631,"Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation.",en
632,"At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun.",en
633,"The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star.The Sun is gradually becoming hotter in its core, hotter at the surface, larger in radius, and more luminous during its time on the main sequence: since the beginning of its main sequence life, it has expanded in radius by 15% and the surface has increased in temperature from 5,620 K to 5,777 K, resulting in a 48% increase in luminosity from 0.677 solar luminosities to its present-day 1.0 solar luminosity.",en
634,"This occurs because the helium atoms in the core have a higher mean molecular weight than the hydrogen atoms that were fused, resulting in less thermal pressure.",en
635,"The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the center, releasing gravitational potential energy.",en
636,"According to the virial theorem, half this released gravitational energy goes into heating, which leads to a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs and thus an increase in the luminosity.",en
637,This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser.,en
638,"At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.",en
639,It takes at least 1 billion years from now to deplete liquid water from the Earth from such increase.,en
640,The Sun does not have enough mass to explode as a supernova.,en
641,"Instead, when it runs out of hydrogen in the core in approximately 5 billion years, core hydrogen fusion will stop and there will be nothing to prevent the core from contracting.",en
642,"The release of gravitational potential energy will cause the luminosity of the star to increase, ending the main sequence phase and leading the star to expand over the next billion years: first into a subgiant, and then into a red giant.",en
643,"The heating due to gravitational contraction will also lead to hydrogen fusion in a shell just outside the core, where unfused hydrogen remains, contributing to the increased luminosity, which will eventually reach more than 1000 times its present luminosity.",en
644,"As a red giant, the Sun will grow so large that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and probably Earth, reaching about 0.75AU.",en
645,The Sun will spend around a billion years as a red-giant branch star and lose around a third of its mass.,en
646,"After the red-giant branch, the Sun has approximately 120 million years of active life left, but much happens.",en
647,"First, the core, full of degenerate helium ignites violently in the helium flash, where it is estimated that 6% of the core, itself 40% of the Sun's mass, will be converted into carbon within a matter of minutes through the triple-alpha process.",en
648,"The Sun then shrinks to around 10 times its current size and 50 times the luminosity, with a temperature a little lower than today.",en
649,"It will then have reached the red clump or horizontal branch, but a star of the Sun's metallicity does not evolve blueward along the horizontal branch.",en
650,"Instead, it just becomes moderately larger and more luminous over about 100 million years as it continues to react helium in the core.When the helium is exhausted, the Sun will repeat the expansion it followed when the hydrogen in the core was exhausted, except that this time it all happens faster, and the Sun becomes larger and more luminous.",en
651,"This is the asymptotic-giant-branch phase, and the Sun is alternately reacting hydrogen in a shell or helium in a deeper shell.",en
652,"After about 20 million years on the early asymptotic giant branch, the Sun becomes increasingly unstable, with rapid mass loss and thermal pulses that increase the size and luminosity for a few hundred years every 100,000 years or so.",en
653,"The thermal pulses become larger each time, with the later pulses pushing the luminosity to as much as 5,000 times the current level and the radius to over 1 AU.",en
654,"According to a 2008 model, Earth's orbit will have initially expanded significantly due to the Sun's loss of mass as a red giant, but will later start shrinking due to tidal forces (and, eventually, drag from the lower chromosphere) so that it is engulfed by the Sun during the tip of the red-giant branch phase, 3.8 and 1 million years after Mercury and Venus have respectively suffered the same fate.",en
655,Models vary depending on the rate and timing of mass loss.,en
656,"Models that have higher mass loss on the red-giant branch produce smaller, less luminous stars at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch, perhaps only 2,000 times the luminosity and less than 200 times the radius.",en
657,"For the Sun, four thermal pulses are predicted before it completely loses its outer envelope and starts to make a planetary nebula.",en
658,"By the end of that phase‚Äîlasting approximately 500,000 years‚Äîthe Sun will only have about half of its current mass.",en
659,The post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolution is even faster.,en
660,"The luminosity stays approximately constant as the temperature increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionized into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K, as if it is in a sort of blue loop.",en
661,"The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K, and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present-day mass.",en
662,"The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical black dwarf.",en
663, The Sun is moved by the gravitational pull of the planets.,en
664,One can think of the barycentre of the Solar System as being stationary (or as moving in a steady motion around the galaxy).,en
665,The centre of the sun is always within 2.2 solar radii of the barycentre.,en
666,"This motion of the Sun is mainly due to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.",en
667,"For some periods of several decades, the motion is rather regular, forming a trefoil pattern, whereas between these periods it appears more chaotic.",en
668,"After 179 years (nine times the synodic period of Jupiter and Saturn) the pattern more or less repeats, but rotated by about 24¬∞.",en
669,"The orbits of the inner planets, including of the Earth, are similarly displaced by the same gravitational forces, so the movement of the Sun has little effect on the relative positions of the Earth and the Sun or on solar irradiance on the Earth as a function of time.",en
670," The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way, and it is presently moving in the direction of the constellation of Cygnus.",en

673,We take X(0) and Y(0) to be zero and Z(0) is estimated to be 17 parsecs.,en
674,This model implies that the Sun circulates around a point that is itself going around the galaxy.,en
675,The period of the Sun's circulation around the point is 2 œÄ/Œ∫.,en
676,"which, using the equivalence that a parsec equals 1 km/s times 0.978 million years, comes to 166 million years, shorter than the time it takes for the point to go around the galaxy.",en

685,Other stars with the same value of X + V/( 2 B ) have to take the same amount of time to go around the galaxy as the sun and thus remain in the same general vicinity as the Sun.,en
686,"The Sun's orbit around the Milky Way is perturbed due to the non-uniform mass distribution in Milky Way, such as that in and between the galactic spiral arms.",en
687,"It has been argued that the Sun's passage through the higher density spiral arms often coincides with mass extinctions on Earth, perhaps due to increased impact events.",en
688,"It takes the Solar System about 225‚Äì250 million years to complete one orbit through the Milky Way (a galactic year), so it is thought to have completed 20‚Äì25 orbits during the lifetime of the Sun.",en

705,"The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone.",en
706,"These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter in the form of heat.",en

2316," The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are lower than those of the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d sub-shell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized.",en
2317,This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.The melting point of iron is experimentally well defined for pressures less than 50 GPa.,en
2318,"For greater pressures, published data (as of 2007) still varies by tens of gigapascals and over a thousand kelvin.",en
2319,"Below its Curie point of 770 ¬∞C, Œ±-iron changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic: the spins of the two unpaired electrons in each atom generally align with the spins of its neighbors, creating an overall magnetic field.",en
2320,"This happens because the orbitals of those two electrons (dz2 and dx2 ‚àí y2) do not point toward neighboring atoms in the lattice, and therefore are not involved in metallic bonding.In the absence of an external source of magnetic field, the atoms get spontaneously partitioned into magnetic domains, about 10 micrometers across, such that the atoms in each domain have parallel spins, but some domains have other orientations.",en
2321,Thus a macroscopic piece of iron will have a nearly zero overall magnetic field.,en
2322,"Application of an external magnetic field causes the domains that are magnetized in the same general direction to grow at the expense of adjacent ones that point in other directions, reinforcing the external field.",en
2323,"This effect is exploited in devices that need to channel magnetic fields to fulfill design function, such as electrical transformers, magnetic recording heads, and electric motors.",en
2324,"Impurities, lattice defects, or grain and particle boundaries can pin the domains in the new positions, so that the effect persists even after the external field is removed ‚Äî thus turning the iron object into a (permanent) magnet.Similar behavior is exhibited by some iron compounds, such as the ferrites including the mineral magnetite, a crystalline form of the mixed iron(II,III) oxide Fe3O4 (although the atomic-scale mechanism, ferrimagnetism, is somewhat different).",en

2335,"Possibly the energy released by the decay of 60Fe, along with that released by 26Al, contributed to the remelting and differentiation of asteroids after their formation 4.6 billion years ago.",en
2336,The abundance of 60Ni present in extraterrestrial material may bring further insight into the origin and early history of the Solar System.The most abundant iron isotope 56Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists because it represents the most common endpoint of nucleosynthesis.,en
2337,"Since 56Ni (14 alpha particles) is easily produced from lighter nuclei in the alpha process in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see silicon burning process), it is the endpoint of fusion chains inside extremely massive stars, since addition of another alpha particle, resulting in 60Zn, requires a great deal more energy.",en
2338,"This 56Ni, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is created in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the supernova remnant gas cloud, first to radioactive 56Co, and then to stable 56Fe.",en
2339,"As such, iron is the most abundant element in the core of red giants, and is the most abundant metal in iron meteorites and in the dense metal cores of planets such as Earth.",en
2340,"It is also very common in the universe, relative to other stable metals of approximately the same atomic weight.",en
2341,"Iron is the sixth most abundant element in the universe, and the most common refractory element.Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing 62Ni, which has a marginally higher binding energy than 56Fe, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process.",en
2342,"Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel, and in any case, 56Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons.",en
2343,"Hence, elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation, involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56Fe nuclei.In the far future of the universe, assuming that proton decay does not occur, cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56Fe nuclei.",en
2344,"Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects to cold spheres of pure iron.",en
2345,"Iron's abundance in rocky planets like Earth is due to its abundant production during the runaway fusion and explosion of type Ia supernovae, which scatters the iron into space.",en

2594,"The average adult human contains about 0.005% body weight of iron, or about four grams, of which three quarters is in hemoglobin ‚Äì a level that remains constant despite only about one milligram of iron being absorbed each day, because the human body recycles its hemoglobin for the iron content.Microbial growth may be assisted by oxidation of iron(II) or by reduction of iron (III).",en
2595, Iron acquisition poses a problem for aerobic organisms because ferric iron is poorly soluble near neutral pH.,en
2596,"Thus, these organisms have developed means to absorb iron as complexes, sometimes taking up ferrous iron before oxidising it back to ferric iron.",en
2597,"In particular, bacteria have evolved very high-affinity sequestering agents called siderophores.After uptake in human cells, iron storage is precisely regulated.",en
2598,"A major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin, which binds iron ions absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells.",en
2599,"Transferrin contains Fe3+ in the middle of a distorted octahedron, bonded to one nitrogen, three oxygens and a chelating carbonate anion that traps the Fe3+ ion: it has such a high stability constant that it is very effective at taking up Fe3+ ions even from the most stable complexes.",en
2600,"At the bone marrow, transferrin is reduced from Fe3+ and Fe2+ and stored as ferritin to be incorporated into hemoglobin.The most commonly known and studied bioinorganic iron compounds (biological iron molecules) are the heme proteins: examples are hemoglobin, myoglobin, and cytochrome P450.",en
2601,"These compounds participate in transporting gases, building enzymes, and transferring electrons.",en
2602,Metalloproteins are a group of proteins with metal ion cofactors.,en
2603,Some examples of iron metalloproteins are ferritin and rubredoxin.,en
2604,"Many enzymes vital to life contain iron, such as catalase, lipoxygenases, and IRE-BP.Hemoglobin is an oxygen carrier that occurs in red blood cells and contributes their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, generating energy.",en
2605,"Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled.",en
2606,"In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue of one of the protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to.",en
2607,"When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion at the center of the heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration.",en
2608,"It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55 picometers above it.",en
2609,"In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.When deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a hydrogen bond with it.",en
2610,"This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar.",en
2611,"(Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe‚ÄìO‚ÄìO bond angle of around 120¬∞ that avoids the formation of Fe‚ÄìO‚ÄìFe or Fe‚ÄìO2‚ÄìFe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.)",en
2612,This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity.,en
2613,"Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa.",en
2614,"Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur.",en
2615,"Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue.",en
2616,"As described by the Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide.",en
2617,"Carbon monoxide and phosphorus trifluoride are poisonous to humans because they bind to hemoglobin similarly to oxygen, but with much more strength, so that oxygen can no longer be transported throughout the body.",en
2618,Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as carboxyhemoglobin.,en
2619,"This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of cyanide, but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a.",en
2620,The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen.,en
2621,"The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a methionine sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen ‚Äì with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide.",en
2622,"Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states.",en
2623,"Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in adenosine triphosphate.",en
2624,"Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows: 4 Cytc2+ + O2 + 8H+inside ‚Üí 4 Cytc3+ + 2 H2O + 4H+outsideAlthough the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states.",en
2625,"These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron.",en
2626,"The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains.",en
2627,"Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms.",en
2628,Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.The ability of sea mussels to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of organometallic iron-based bonds in their protein-rich cuticles.,en

2775,"As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans more than any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.",en
2776,Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs.,en
2777,"These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.Unlike other domestic species selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors.",en
2778,"In 2016, a study found that only 11 fixed genes showed variation between wolves and dogs.",en
2779,These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication.,en
2780,"These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e., selection for tameness) and emotional processing.",en
2781,Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves.,en
2782,"Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and later in breed formation.",en
2783,"Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem-solving ability.",en
2784,Dog intelligence is the dog's ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems.,en
2785,Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills.,en
2786,"A study with Rico, a Border Collie, showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items.",en
2787,He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure.,en
2788,"A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory capabilities.",en
2789,"He had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words.",en
2790,Dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing and human voice commands.,en
2791,"One study of canine cognitive abilities found that dogs' capabilities are no more exceptional than those of other animals, such as horses, chimpanzees, or cats.",en
2792,"One limited study of 18 household dogs found that they lacked spatial memory, and were more focussed on the what of a task rather than the where.Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception.",en
2793,"An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined up with humans.",en
2794,"Another study revealed that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs faced with an unsolvable version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not.",en
2795,"Dog communication is how dogs convey information to other dogs, understand messages from humans and translate the information that dogs are transmitting.",en

2800,About 20% of dogs live as pets in developed countries.,en
2801,"In the developing world, dogs are more commonly feral or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon.",en
2802,"Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%).",en
2803,"Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, strays, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes.",en
2804," Although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans.",en
2805,"For example, a review of the studies in dogs' competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves.",en
2806,"Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together.",en
2807,"In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed.",en
2808,"Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.Coyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs.",en

2814,Dogs have been described as omnivores.,en
2815,"Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.",en
2816,"Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high starch diet.",en
2817,"However, more like cats and less like other omnivores, dogs can only produce bile acid with taurine and they cannot produce vitamin D, which they obtain from animal flesh.",en
2818,"Also, more like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain its nitrogen balance.",en
2819,These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.,en
2820," As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly universal among human societies.",en
2821,"Notable exceptions once included:The Aboriginal Tasmanians, who were separated from Australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent The Andamanese peoples, who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to Myanmar The Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, a different canid species Individual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs, or where dogs died out after original settlement, notably the Mariana Islands, Palau and most of the Caroline Islands with exceptions such as Fais Island and Nukuoro, the Marshall Islands, the Gilbert Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tonga, Marquesas, Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter Island, the Chatham Islands and Pitcairn Island (settled by the Bounty mutineers, who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships).Dogs were introduced to Antarctica as sled dogs, but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections.",en
2822," Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with a complex body language.",en
2823,"These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness and ability to fit into human households and social situations.",en
2824,These attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful animals today.The dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to their quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures.,en
2825,"Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship and aiding disabled individuals.",en

2830,Pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased.,en
2831,"In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today(the expression in the doghouse - recorded since 1932 - to describe exclusion from the group implies a distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion.",en
2832,"From the 1980s, there have been changes in the pet dog's role, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians.",en
2833,People and their dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives to the point where pet dogs actively shape how a family and home are experienced.There have been two significant trends occurring within the second half of the 20th century in pet dogs' changing status.,en
2834,"The first has been commodification, shaping it to conform to social expectations of personality and behavior.",en
2835,The second has been the broadening of the family's concept and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.A vast range of commodity forms aims to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion.,en
2836,"The list of goods, services, and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries.",en
2837,"Dog training books, classes, and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.The majority of contemporary dog owners describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog-human family as a pack.",en
2838,"Some dog trainers, such as on the television program Dog Whisperer, have promoted a dominance model of dog-human relationships.",en
2839,"However, it has been disputed that trying to achieve status is characteristic of dog-human interactions.",en
2840,"Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog-human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog; to mediate their interactions with each other.Increasingly, human family-members engage in activities centered on the dog's perceived needs and interests, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.According to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009‚Äì2010, an estimated 77.5 million people in the United States have pet dogs.",en

2980,Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons.,en
2981,"In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain.",en
2982,"Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system.",en
2983,"Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.The most simple eyes, pit eyes, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light.",en
2984,"From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex.",en

3015,Note that simple does not imply a reduced level of complexity or acuity.,en
3016,"Indeed, any eye type can be adapted for almost any behaviour or environment.",en
3017,The only limitations specific to eye types are that of resolution‚Äîthe physics of compound eyes prevents them from achieving a resolution better than 1¬∞.,en
3018,"Also, superposition eyes can achieve greater sensitivity than apposition eyes, so are better suited to dark-dwelling creatures.",en
3019,"Eyes also fall into two groups on the basis of their photoreceptor's cellular construction, with the photoreceptor cells either being cilliated (as in the vertebrates) or rhabdomeric.",en
3020,"These two groups are not monophyletic; the cnidaria also possess cilliated cells,and some gastropods, as well as some annelids possess both.Some organisms have photosensitive cells that do nothing but detect whether the surroundings are light or dark, which is sufficient for the entrainment of circadian rhythms.",en
3021,"These are not considered eyes because they lack enough structure to be considered an organ, and do not produce an image.",en
3022," Simple eyes are rather ubiquitous, and lens-bearing eyes have evolved at least seven times in vertebrates, cephalopods, annelids, crustaceans and cubozoa.",en
3023," Pit eyesPit eyes, also known as stemma, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light.",en
3024,"Found in about 85% of phyla, these basic forms were probably the precursors to more advanced types of simple eyes.",en
3025,"They are small, comprising up to about 100 cells covering about 100 ¬µm.",en
3026,"The directionality can be improved by reducing the size of the aperture, by incorporating a reflective layer behind the receptor cells, or by filling the pit with a refractile material.Pit vipers have developed pits that function as eyes by sensing thermal infra-red radiation, in addition to their optical wavelength eyes like those of other vertebrates (see infrared sensing in snakes).",en
3027,"However, pit organs are fitted with receptors rather different from photoreceptors, namely a specific transient receptor potential channel (TRP channels) called TRPV1.",en
3028,The main difference is that photoreceptors are G-protein coupled receptors but TRP are ion channels.,en
3029," Spherical lens eyeThe resolution of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material with a higher refractive index to form a lens, which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered‚Äîhence increasing the resolution obtainable.",en
3030,"The most basic form, seen in some gastropods and annelids, consists of a lens of one refractive index.",en
3031,"A far sharper image can be obtained using materials with a high refractive index, decreasing to the edges; this decreases the focal length and thus allows a sharp image to form on the retina.",en
3032,"This also allows a larger aperture for a given sharpness of image, allowing more light to enter the lens; and a flatter lens, reducing spherical aberration.",en
3033,"Such a non-homogeneous lens is necessary for the focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius, to 2.5 radii.Heterogeneous eyes have evolved at least nine times: four or more times in gastropods, once in the copepods, once in the annelids, once in the cephalopods, and once in the chitons, which have aragonite lenses.",en
3034,No extant aquatic organisms possess homogeneous lenses; presumably the evolutionary pressure for a heterogeneous lens is great enough for this stage to be quickly outgrown.This eye creates an image that is sharp enough that motion of the eye can cause significant blurring.,en
3035,"To minimise the effect of eye motion while the animal moves, most such eyes have stabilising eye muscles.The ocelli of insects bear a simple lens, but their focal point usually lies behind the retina; consequently, those can't form a sharp image.",en
3036,"Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image across the whole retina, and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field; this fast response is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush the information to the brain.",en
3037,"Focusing the image would also cause the sun's image to be focused on a few receptors, with the possibility of damage under the intense light; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity.",en
3038,"This fast response has led to suggestions that the ocelli of insects are used mainly in flight, because they can be used to detect sudden changes in which way is up (because light, especially UV light which is absorbed by vegetation, usually comes from above).",en
3039, Multiple lensesSome marine organisms bear more than one lens; for instance the copepod Pontella has three.,en
3040,"The outer has a parabolic surface, countering the effects of spherical aberration while allowing a sharp image to be formed.",en
3041,"Another copepod, Copilia, has two lenses in each eye, arranged like those in a telescope.",en
3042,"Such arrangements are rare and poorly understood, but represent an alternative construction.",en
3043,"Multiple lenses are seen in some hunters such as eagles and jumping spiders, which have a refractive cornea: these have a negative lens, enlarging the observed image by up to 50% over the receptor cells, thus increasing their optical resolution.",en
3044," Refractive corneaIn the eyes of most mammals, birds, reptiles, and most other terrestrial vertebrates (along with spiders and some insect larvae) the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air.",en
3045,"In general, the lens is not spherical.",en
3046,Spherical lenses produce spherical aberration.,en
3047,"In refractive corneas, the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material (see Luneburg lens), or with an aspheric shape.",en
3048,Flattening the lens has a disadvantage; the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus.,en
3049,"Thus, animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens.As mentioned above, a refractive cornea is only useful out of water.",en
3050,"In water, there is little difference in refractive index between the vitreous fluid and the surrounding water.",en
3051,"Hence creatures that have returned to the water‚Äîpenguins and seals, for example‚Äîlose their highly curved cornea and return to lens-based vision.",en
3052,"An alternative solution, borne by some divers, is to have a very strongly focusing cornea.",en
3053," Reflector eyesAn alternative to a lens is to line the inside of the eye with mirrors, and reflect the image to focus at a central point.",en
3054,"The nature of these eyes means that if one were to peer into the pupil of an eye, one would see the same image that the organism would see, reflected back out.Many small organisms such as rotifers, copepods and flatworms use such organs, but these are too small to produce usable images.",en
3055,"Some larger organisms, such as scallops, also use reflector eyes.",en
3056,The scallop Pecten has up to 100 millimetre-scale reflector eyes fringing the edge of its shell.,en
3057,"It detects moving objects as they pass successive lenses.There is at least one vertebrate, the spookfish, whose eyes include reflective optics for focusing of light.",en
3058,"Each of the two eyes of a spookfish collects light from both above and below; the light coming from above is focused by a lens, while that coming from below, by a curved mirror composed of many layers of small reflective plates made of guanine crystals.",en
3059,"A compound eye may consist of thousands of individual photoreceptor units or ommatidia (ommatidium, singular).",en
3060,"The image perceived is a combination of inputs from the numerous ommatidia (individual eye units), which are located on a convex surface, thus pointing in slightly different directions.",en
3061,"Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a very large view angle, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarisation of light.",en
3062,"Because the individual lenses are so small, the effects of diffraction impose a limit on the possible resolution that can be obtained (assuming that they do not function as phased arrays).",en
3063,This can only be countered by increasing lens size and number.,en
3064,"To see with a resolution comparable to our simple eyes, humans would require very large compound eyes, around 11 metres (36 ft) in radius.Compound eyes fall into two groups: apposition eyes, which form multiple inverted images, and superposition eyes, which form a single erect image.",en
3065,"Compound eyes are common in arthropods, annelids and some bivalved molluscs.",en
3066,Compound eyes in arthropods grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia.,en
3067, Apposition eyesApposition eyes are the most common form of eyes and are presumably the ancestral form of compound eyes.,en
3068,"They are found in all arthropod groups, although they may have evolved more than once within this phylum.",en
3069,Some annelids and bivalves also have apposition eyes.,en
3070,"They are also possessed by Limulus, the horseshoe crab, and there are suggestions that other chelicerates developed their simple eyes by reduction from a compound starting point.",en
3071,(Some caterpillars appear to have evolved compound eyes from simple eyes in the opposite fashion.),en
3072,"Apposition eyes work by gathering a number of images, one from each eye, and combining them in the brain, with each eye typically contributing a single point of information.",en
3073,"The typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the rhabdom, while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium.",en
3074, Superposition eyesThe second type is named the superposition eye.,en
3075,"The superposition eye is divided into three types:refracting, reflecting and parabolic superpositionThe refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the rhabdom, and no side wall.",en
3076,Each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side.,en
3077,"The result is an image at half the radius of the eye, which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are.",en
3078,"This type of compound eye, for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition cannot occur, is normally found in nocturnal insects, because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes, though at the cost of reduced resolution.",en
3079,"In the parabolic superposition compound eye type, seen in arthropods such as mayflies, the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array.",en
3080,"Long-bodied decapod crustaceans such as shrimp, prawns, crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes, which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses.",en
3081," Parabolic superpositionThis eye type functions by refracting light, then using a parabolic mirror to focus the image; it combines features of superposition and apposition eyes.",en
3082," OtherAnother kind of compound eye, found in males of Order Strepsiptera, employs a series of simple eyes‚Äîeyes having one opening that provides light for an entire image-forming retina.",en
3083,"Several of these eyelets together form the strepsipteran compound eye, which is similar to the 'schizochroal' compound eyes of some trilobites.",en
3084,"Because each eyelet is a simple eye, it produces an inverted image; those images are combined in the brain to form one unified image.",en
3085,"Because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye, this arrangement allows vision under low light levels.Good fliers such as flies or honey bees, or prey-catching insects such as praying mantis or dragonflies, have specialised zones of ommatidia organised into a fovea area which gives acute vision.",en
3086,"In the acute zone, the eyes are flattened and the facets larger.",en
3087,The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution.,en
3088,"The black spot that can be seen on the compound eyes of such insects, which always seems to look directly at the observer, is called a pseudopupil.",en
3089,"This occurs because the ommatidia which one observes head-on (along their optical axes) absorb the incident light, while those to one side reflect it.There are some exceptions from the types mentioned above.",en
3090,"Some insects have a so-called single lens compound eye, a transitional type which is something between a superposition type of the multi-lens compound eye and the single lens eye found in animals with simple eyes.",en
3091,"Then there is the mysid shrimp, Dioptromysis paucispinosa.",en
3092,"The shrimp has an eye of the refracting superposition type, in the rear behind this in each eye there is a single large facet that is three times in diameter the others in the eye and behind this is an enlarged crystalline cone.",en
3093,This projects an upright image on a specialised retina.,en
3094,The resulting eye is a mixture of a simple eye within a compound eye.,en
3095,"Another version is a compound eye often referred to as pseudofaceted, as seen in Scutigera.",en
3096,"This type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ommatidia on each side of the head, organised in a way that resembles a true compound eye.",en
3097,"The body of Ophiocoma wendtii, a type of brittle star, is covered with ommatidia, turning its whole skin into a compound eye.",en
3098,The same is true of many chitons.,en
3099,"The tube feet of sea urchins contain photoreceptor proteins, which together act as a compound eye; they lack screening pigments, but can detect the directionality of light by the shadow cast by its opaque body.",en
3100," NutrientsThe ciliary body is triangular in horizontal section and is coated by a double layer, the ciliary epithelium.",en
3101,"The inner layer is transparent and covers the vitreous body, and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina.",en
3102,"The outer layer is highly pigmented, continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium, and constitutes the cells of the dilator muscle.",en
3103,"The vitreous is the transparent, colourless, gelatinous mass that fills the space between the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye.",en
3104,It is produced by certain retinal cells.,en
3105,"It is of rather similar composition to the cornea, but contains very few cells (mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field, as well as the hyalocytes of Balazs of the surface of the vitreous, which reprocess the hyaluronic acid), no blood vessels, and 98‚Äì99% of its volume is water (as opposed to 75% in the cornea) with salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of collagen type II fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid, and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts.",en
3106,"Amazingly, with so little solid matter, it tautly holds the eye.",en
3107,"Photoreception is phylogenetically very old, with various theories of phylogenesis.",en
3108,The common origin (monophyly) of all animal eyes is now widely accepted as fact.,en
3109,"This is based upon the shared genetic features of all eyes; that is, all modern eyes, varied as they are, have their origins in a proto-eye believed to have evolved some 650-600 million years ago, and the PAX6 gene is considered a key factor in this.",en
3110,"The majority of the advancements in early eyes are believed to have taken only a few million years to develop, since the first predator to gain true imaging would have touched off an arms race among all species that did not flee the photopic environment.",en
3111,Prey animals and competing predators alike would be at a distinct disadvantage without such capabilities and would be less likely to survive and reproduce.,en
3112,"Hence multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel (except those of groups, such as the vertebrates, that were only forced into the photopic environment at a late stage).",en
3113,Eyes in various animals show adaptation to their requirements.,en
3114,"For example, the eye of a bird of prey has much greater visual acuity than a human eye, and in some cases can detect ultraviolet radiation.",en
3115,"The different forms of eye in, for example, vertebrates and molluscs are examples of parallel evolution, despite their distant common ancestry.",en
3116,"Phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye, but this is not the case, as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric opsin classes and different lens crystallins show.The very earliest eyes, called eye-spots, were simple patches of photoreceptor protein in unicellular animals.",en
3117,"In multicellular beings, multicellular eyespots evolved, physically similar to the receptor patches for taste and smell.",en
3118,"These eyespots could only sense ambient brightness: they could distinguish light and dark, but not the direction of the light source.Through gradual change, the eye-spots of species living in well-lit environments depressed into a shallow cup shape.",en
3119,The ability to slightly discriminate directional brightness was achieved by using the angle at which the light hit certain cells to identify the source.,en
3120,"The pit deepened over time, the opening diminished in size, and the number of photoreceptor cells increased, forming an effective pinhole camera that was capable of dimly distinguishing shapes.",en
3121,"However, the ancestors of modern hagfish, thought to be the protovertebrate, were evidently pushed to very deep, dark waters, where they were less vulnerable to sighted predators, and where it is advantageous to have a convex eye-spot, which gathers more light than a flat or concave one.",en
3122,This would have led to a somewhat different evolutionary trajectory for the vertebrate eye than for other animal eyes.,en
3123,"The thin overgrowth of transparent cells over the eye's aperture, originally formed to prevent damage to the eyespot, allowed the segregated contents of the eye chamber to specialise into a transparent humour that optimised colour filtering, blocked harmful radiation, improved the eye's refractive index, and allowed functionality outside of water.",en
3124,"The transparent protective cells eventually split into two layers, with circulatory fluid in between that allowed wider viewing angles and greater imaging resolution, and the thickness of the transparent layer gradually increased, in most species with the transparent crystallin protein.The gap between tissue layers naturally formed a biconvex shape, an optimally ideal structure for a normal refractive index.",en
3125,"Independently, a transparent layer and a nontransparent layer split forward from the lens: the cornea and iris.",en
3126,"Separation of the forward layer again formed a humour, the aqueous humour.",en
3127,This increased refractive power and again eased circulatory problems.,en
3128,"Formation of a nontransparent ring allowed more blood vessels, more circulation, and larger eye sizes.",en
3129, Eyes are generally adapted to the environment and life requirements of the organism which bears them.,en
3130,"For instance, the distribution of photoreceptors tends to match the area in which the highest acuity is required, with horizon-scanning organisms, such as those that live on the African plains, having a horizontal line of high-density ganglia, while tree-dwelling creatures which require good all-round vision tend to have a symmetrical distribution of ganglia, with acuity decreasing outwards from the centre.",en
3131,"Of course, for most eye types, it is impossible to diverge from a spherical form, so only the density of optical receptors can be altered.",en
3132,"In organisms with compound eyes, it is the number of ommatidia rather than ganglia that reflects the region of highest data acquisition.",en
3133,":‚Ää23‚Äì24‚Ää Optical superposition eyes are constrained to a spherical shape, but other forms of compound eyes may deform to a shape where more ommatidia are aligned to, say, the horizon, without altering the size or density of individual ommatidia.",en
3134,"Eyes of horizon-scanning organisms have stalks so they can be easily aligned to the horizon when this is inclined, for example, if the animal is on a slope.An extension of this concept is that the eyes of predators typically have a zone of very acute vision at their centre, to assist in the identification of prey.",en
3135,"In deep water organisms, it may not be the centre of the eye that is enlarged.",en
3136,The hyperiid amphipods are deep water animals that feed on organisms above them.,en
3137,"Their eyes are almost divided into two, with the upper region thought to be involved in detecting the silhouettes of potential prey‚Äîor predators‚Äîagainst the faint light of the sky above.",en
3138,"Accordingly, deeper water hyperiids, where the light against which the silhouettes must be compared is dimmer, have larger upper-eyes, and may lose the lower portion of their eyes altogether.",en
3139,In the giant Antarctic isopod Glyptonotus a small ventral compound eye is physically completely separated from the much larger dorsal compound eye.,en
3140,"Depth perception can be enhanced by having eyes which are enlarged in one direction; distorting the eye slightly allows the distance to the object to be estimated with a high degree of accuracy.Acuity is higher among male organisms that mate in mid-air, as they need to be able to spot and assess potential mates against a very large backdrop.",en
3141,"On the other hand, the eyes of organisms which operate in low light levels, such as around dawn and dusk or in deep water, tend to be larger to increase the amount of light that can be captured.It is not only the shape of the eye that may be affected by lifestyle.",en
3142,"Eyes can be the most visible parts of organisms, and this can act as a pressure on organisms to have more transparent eyes at the cost of function.Eyes may be mounted on stalks to provide better all-round vision, by lifting them above an organism's carapace; this also allows them to track predators or prey without moving the head.",en
3143," Visual acuity, or resolving power, is the ability to distinguish fine detail and is the property of cone cells.",en
3144,"It is often measured in cycles per degree (CPD), which measures an angular resolution, or how much an eye can differentiate one object from another in terms of visual angles.",en
3145,Resolution in CPD can be measured by bar charts of different numbers of white/black stripe cycles.,en
3146,"For example, if each pattern is 1.75 cm wide and is placed at 1 m distance from the eye, it will subtend an angle of 1 degree, so the number of white/black bar pairs on the pattern will be a measure of the cycles per degree of that pattern.",en
3147,"The highest such number that the eye can resolve as stripes, or distinguish from a grey block, is then the measurement of visual acuity of the eye.",en
3148,"For a human eye with excellent acuity, the maximum theoretical resolution is 50 CPD (1.2 arcminute per line pair, or a 0.35 mm line pair, at 1 m).",en
3149,A rat can resolve only about 1 to 2 CPD.,en
3150,"A horse has higher acuity through most of the visual field of its eyes than a human has, but does not match the high acuity of the human eye's central fovea region.Spherical aberration limits the resolution of a 7 mm pupil to about 3 arcminutes per line pair.",en
3151,"At a pupil diameter of 3 mm, the spherical aberration is greatly reduced, resulting in an improved resolution of approximately 1.7 arcminutes per line pair.",en
3152,"A resolution of 2 arcminutes per line pair, equivalent to a 1 arcminute gap in an optotype, corresponds to 20/20 (normal vision) in humans.",en
3153,"However, in the compound eye, the resolution is related to the size of individual ommatidia and the distance between neighbouring ommatidia.",en
3154,Physically these cannot be reduced in size to achieve the acuity seen with single lensed eyes as in mammals.,en
3155,Compound eyes have a much lower acuity than vertebrate eyes.,en
3156,Colour vision is the faculty of the organism to distinguish lights of different spectral qualities.,en
3157,"All organisms are restricted to a small range of electromagnetic spectrum; this varies from creature to creature, but is mainly between wavelengths of 400 and 700 nm.",en
3158,"This is a rather small section of the electromagnetic spectrum, probably reflecting the submarine evolution of the organ: water blocks out all but two small windows of the EM spectrum, and there has been no evolutionary pressure among land animals to broaden this range.The most sensitive pigment, rhodopsin, has a peak response at 500 nm.",en
3159,"Small changes to the genes coding for this protein can tweak the peak response by a few nm; pigments in the lens can also filter incoming light, changing the peak response.",en
3160,"Many organisms are unable to discriminate between colours, seeing instead in shades of grey; colour vision necessitates a range of pigment cells which are primarily sensitive to smaller ranges of the spectrum.",en
3161,"In primates, geckos, and other organisms, these take the form of cone cells, from which the more sensitive rod cells evolved.",en
3162,"Even if organisms are physically capable of discriminating different colours, this does not necessarily mean that they can perceive the different colours; only with behavioural tests can this be deduced.Most organisms with colour vision can detect ultraviolet light.",en
3163,This high energy light can be damaging to receptor cells.,en
3164,"With a few exceptions (snakes, placental mammals), most organisms avoid these effects by having absorbent oil droplets around their cone cells.",en
3165,"The alternative, developed by organisms that had lost these oil droplets in the course of evolution, is to make the lens impervious to UV light‚Äîthis precludes the possibility of any UV light being detected, as it does not even reach the retina.",en
3166, The retina contains two major types of light-sensitive photoreceptor cells used for vision: the rods and the cones.,en
3167,"Rods cannot distinguish colours, but are responsible for low-light (scotopic) monochrome (black-and-white) vision; they work well in dim light as they contain a pigment, rhodopsin (visual purple), which is sensitive at low light intensity, but saturates at higher (photopic) intensities.",en
3168,Rods are distributed throughout the retina but there are none at the fovea and none at the blind spot.,en
3169,Rod density is greater in the peripheral retina than in the central retina.,en
3170,Cones are responsible for colour vision.,en
3171,They require brighter light to function than rods require.,en
3172,"In humans, there are three types of cones, maximally sensitive to long-wavelength, medium-wavelength, and short-wavelength light (often referred to as red, green, and blue, respectively, though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours).",en
3173,"The colour seen is the combined effect of stimuli to, and responses from, these three types of cone cells.",en
3174,Cones are mostly concentrated in and near the fovea.,en
3175,Only a few are present at the sides of the retina.,en
3176,"Objects are seen most sharply in focus when their images fall on the fovea, as when one looks at an object directly.",en
3177,Cone cells and rods are connected through intermediate cells in the retina to nerve fibres of the optic nerve.,en
3178,"When rods and cones are stimulated by light, they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres.",en
3179,The optic nerves send off impulses through these fibres to the brain.,en
3180," The pigment molecules used in the eye are various, but can be used to define the evolutionary distance between different groups, and can also be an aid in determining which are closely related‚Äîalthough problems of convergence do exist.Opsins are the pigments involved in photoreception.",en
3181,"Other pigments, such as melanin, are used to shield the photoreceptor cells from light leaking in from the sides.",en
3182,"The opsin protein group evolved long before the last common ancestor of animals, and has continued to diversify since.There are two types of opsin involved in vision; c-opsins, which are associated with ciliary-type photoreceptor cells, and r-opsins, associated with rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells.",en
3183,"The eyes of vertebrates usually contain ciliary cells with c-opsins, and (bilaterian) invertebrates have rhabdomeric cells in the eye with r-opsins.",en
3184,"However, some ganglion cells of vertebrates express r-opsins, suggesting that their ancestors used this pigment in vision, and that remnants survive in the eyes.",en
3185,"Likewise, c-opsins have been found to be expressed in the brain of some invertebrates.",en
3186,"They may have been expressed in ciliary cells of larval eyes, which were subsequently resorbed into the brain on metamorphosis to the adult form.",en
3187,"C-opsins are also found in some derived bilaterian-invertebrate eyes, such as the pallial eyes of the bivalve molluscs; however, the lateral eyes (which were presumably the ancestral type for this group, if eyes evolved once there) always use r-opsins.",en
3188,"Cnidaria, which are an outgroup to the taxa mentioned above, express c-opsins‚Äîbut r-opsins are yet to be found in this group.",en

3328,"These kappa-casein molecules all have a negative electrical charge and therefore repel each other, keeping the micelles separated under normal conditions and in a stable colloidal suspension in the water-based surrounding fluid.Milk contains dozens of other types of proteins beside caseins and including enzymes.",en
3329,These other proteins are more water-soluble than caseins and do not form larger structures.,en

3339," Calcium phosphate structureFor many years the most widely accepted theory of the structure of a micelle was that it was composed of spherical casein aggregates, called submicelles, that were held together by calcium phosphate linkages.",en
3340,"However, there are two recent models of the casein micelle that refute the distinct micellular structures within the micelle.",en
3341,"The first theory, attributed to de Kruif and Holt, proposes that nanoclusters of calcium phosphate and the phosphopeptide fraction of beta-casein are the centerpiece to micellar structure.",en
3342,"Specifically in this view unstructured proteins organize around the calcium phosphate, giving rise to their structure, and thus no specific structure is formed.",en
3343,"Under the second theory, proposed by Horne, the growth of calcium phosphate nanoclusters begins the process of micelle formation, but is limited by binding phosphopeptide loop regions of the caseins.",en

3361,"Dairies print best before dates on each container, after which stores remove any unsold milk from their shelves.",en
3362,A side effect of the heating of pasteurization is that some vitamin and mineral content is lost.,en
3363,"Soluble calcium and phosphorus decrease by 5%, thiamin and vitamin B12 by 10%, and vitamin C by 20%.",en
3364,"Because losses are small in comparison to the large amount of the two B-vitamins present, milk continues to provide significant amounts of thiamin and vitamin B12.",en
3365,"The loss of vitamin C is not nutritionally significant, as milk is not an important dietary source of vitamin C.FiltrationMicrofiltration is a process that partially replaces pasteurization and produces milk with fewer microorganisms and longer shelf life without a change in the taste of the milk.",en
3366,"In this process, cream is separated from the skimmed milk and is pasteurized in the usual way, but the skimmed milk is forced through ceramic microfilters that trap 99.9% of microorganisms in the milk (as compared to 99.999% killing of microorganisms in standard HTST pasteurization).",en
3367,The skimmed milk then is recombined with the pasteurized cream to reconstitute the original milk composition.,en
3368,"Ultrafiltration uses finer filters than microfiltration, which allow lactose and water to pass through while retaining fats, calcium and protein.",en
3369,"As with microfiltration, the fat may be removed before filtration and added back in afterwards.",en

3373,Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators.,en
3374,"The fat globules rise to the top of a container of milk because fat is less dense than water.The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening.",en
3375,"The cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat in the milk tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins.",en
3376,These clusters rise faster than individual globules can.,en
3377,"The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.Milk often is homogenized, a treatment that prevents a cream layer from separating out of the milk.",en
3378,"The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation.",en
3379,"A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than a smaller number of larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them.",en
3380,Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces.,en
3381,Nearly one-third of the micelles in the milk end up participating in this new membrane structure.,en
3382,The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation.,en
3383,"The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors.",en

3656,The periodic table and law are now a central and indispensable part of modern chemistry.,en
3657,The periodic table continues to evolve with the progress of science.,en
3658,"In nature, only elements up to atomic number 94 exist; to go further, it was necessary to synthesise new elements in the laboratory.",en
3659,"Today, all the first 118 elements are known, completing the first seven rows of the table, but chemical characterisation is still needed for the heaviest elements to confirm that their properties match their positions.",en
3660,It is not yet known how far the table will stretch beyond these seven rows and whether the patterns of the known part of the table will continue into this unknown region.,en
3661,Some scientific discussion also continues regarding whether some elements are correctly positioned in today's table.,en
3662,"Many alternative representations of the periodic law exist, and there is some discussion as to whether or not there is an optimal form of the periodic table.",en
3663,The smallest constituents of all normal matter are known as atoms.,en
3664,"Atoms are extremely small, being about one ten-billionth of a meter across; thus their internal structure is governed by quantum mechanics.",en
3665,"Atoms consist of a small positively charged nucleus, made of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons; the charges cancel out, so atoms are neutral.",en
3666,"Electrons participate in chemical reactions, but the nucleus does not.",en
3667,"When atoms participate in chemical reactions, they may gain or lose electrons to form positively- or negatively-charged ions; or they may share electrons with each other instead.Atoms can be subdivided into different types based on the number of protons (and thus also electrons) they have.",en
3668,"This is called the atomic number, often symbolised Z as German for number is Zahl.",en
3669,Each distinct atomic number therefore corresponds to a class of atom: these classes are called the chemical elements.,en
3670,The chemical elements are what the periodic table classifies and organises.,en
3671,"Hydrogen is the element with atomic number 1; helium, atomic number 2; lithium, atomic number 3; and so on.",en
3672,"Each of these names can be further abbreviated by a one- or two-letter chemical symbol; those for hydrogen, helium, and lithium are respectively H, He, and Li.",en
3673,"Neutrons do not affect the atom's chemical identity, but do affect its weight.",en
3674,Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes of the same chemical element.,en
3675,"Naturally occurring elements usually occur as mixes of different isotopes; since each isotope usually occurs with a characteristic abundance, naturally occurring elements have well-defined atomic weights, defined as the average mass of a naturally occurring atom of that element.Today, 118 elements are known, the first 94 of which are known to occur naturally on Earth today.",en
3676,"Of the 94 natural elements, eighty are stable; three more (bismuth, thorium, and uranium) undergo radioactive decay, but so slowly that large quantities survive from the formation of the Earth; and eleven more decay quickly enough that their continued trace occurrence rests primarily on being constantly regenerated as intermediate products of the decay of thorium and uranium.",en
3677,The 83 elements that have survived from the formation of the Earth are called primordial.,en
3678,"All 24 known artificial elements are radioactive.The periodic table is a graphic description of the periodic law, which states that the properties and atomic structures of the chemical elements are a periodic function of their atomic number.",en
3679,"Elements are placed in the periodic table by their electron configurations, which exhibit periodic recurrences that explain the trends of properties across the periodic table.An electron can be thought of as inhabiting an atomic orbital, which characterises the probability it can be found in any particular region of the atom.",en
3680,"Their energies are quantised, which is to say that they can only take discrete values.",en
3681,"Furthermore, electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle: different electrons must always be in different states.",en
3682,"This allows classification of the possible states an electron can take in various energy levels known as shells, divided into individual subshells, which each contain a certain kind of orbital.",en
3683,"Each orbital can contain up to two electrons: they are distinguished by a quantity known as spin, which can be up or down.",en
3684,"Electrons arrange themselves in the atom in such a way that the total energy they have is minimised, so they occupy the lowest-energy orbitals available unless energy has been supplied.",en
3685,Only the outermost electrons (so-called valence electrons) have enough energy to break free of the nucleus and participate in chemical reactions with other atoms.,en
3686,The others are called core electrons.,en
3687,Elements are known with up to the first seven shells occupied.,en
3688,"The first shell contains only one orbital, a spherical s orbital.",en
3689,"As it is in the first shell, this is called the 1s orbital.",en
3690,This can hold up to two electrons.,en
3691,"The second shell similarly contains a 2s orbital, but it also contains three dumbbell-shaped p orbitals, and can thus fill up to eight electrons (2√ó1 + 2√ó3 = 8).",en
3692,"The third shell contains one 3s orbital, three 3p orbitals, and five 3d orbitals, and thus has a capacity of 2√ó1 + 2√ó3 + 2√ó5 = 18.",en
3693,"The fourth shell contains one 4s orbital, three 4p orbitals, five 4d orbitals, and seven 4f orbitals, thus leading to a capacity of 2√ó1 + 2√ó3 + 2√ó5 + 2√ó7 = 32.",en
3694,"Higher shells contain more types of orbitals that continue the pattern, but such types of orbitals are not filled in the known elements.",en
3695,The subshell types are characterised by the quantum numbers.,en
3696,"Four numbers describe an electron in an atom completely: the principal quantum number n (the shell), the azimuthal quantum number ‚Ñì (the orbital type), the magnetic quantum number m‚Ñì (which of the orbitals of a certain type it is in), and the spin quantum number s.The sequence in which the orbitals are filled is given by the Aufbau principle, also known as the Madelung or Klechkovsky rule.",en
3697,"The shells overlap in energies, creating a sequence that goes approximately as follows: 1s ‚â™ 2s < 2p ‚â™ 3s < 3p ‚â™ 4s < 3d < 4p ‚â™ 5s < 4d < 5p ‚â™ 6s < 4f < 5d < 6p ‚â™ 7s < 5f < 6d < 7p ‚â™ ...Here the sign ‚â™ means much less than as opposed to < meaning just less than.",en
3698,"Phrased differently, electrons enter orbitals in order of increasing n + ‚Ñì, and if two orbitals are available with the same value of n + ‚Ñì, the one with lower n is occupied first.The overlaps get quite close at the point where the d-orbitals enter the picture, and the order can shift slightly with atomic number and atomic charge.Starting from the simplest atom, this lets us build up the periodic table one at a time in order of atomic number, by considering the cases of single atoms.",en
3699,"In hydrogen, there is only one electron, which must go in the lowest-energy orbital 1s.",en
3700,This configuration is thus written 1s1.,en
3701,"Helium adds a second electron, which also goes into 1s and fills the first shell completely.The third element, lithium, has no more space in the first shell.",en
3702,"Its third electron must thus enter the 2s subshell, giving a 1s2 2s1 configuration.",en
3703,"The 2s electron is lithium's only valence electron, as the 1s orbital is now too close to the nucleus to participate chemically.",en
3704,The 2s subshell is completed by the next element beryllium (1s2 2s2).,en
3705,The following elements then proceed to fill up the p-orbitals.,en
3706,Boron (1s2 2s2 2p1) puts its new electron in a 2p orbital; carbon (1s2 2s2 2p2) fills a second 2p orbital; and with nitrogen (1s2 2s2 2p3) all three 2p orbitals become singly occupied.,en
3707,"This is consistent with Hund's rule, which states that atoms will prefer to singly occupy each orbital of the same type before filling them with the second electron.",en
3708,"Oxygen (1s2 2s2 2p4), fluorine (1s2 2s2 2p5), and neon (1s2 2s2 2p6) then complete the already singly filled 2p orbitals; the last of these fills the second shell completely.Starting from element 11, sodium, there is no more space in the second shell, which from here on is a core shell just like the first.",en
3709,Thus the eleventh electron enters the 3s orbital instead.,en
3710,"The 1s2 2s2 2p6 core is abbreviated [Ne], as it is identical to the electron configuration of neon: thus sodium's configuration is written [Ne] 3s1.",en
3711,"Magnesium ([Ne] 3s2) finishes this 3s orbital, and from then on the six elements aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and argon fill the three 3p orbitals ([Ne] 3s2 3p1 through [Ne] 3s2 3p6).",en
3712,"This creates an analogous series in which the outer shell structures of sodium through argon are exactly analogous to those of lithium through neon, and is the basis for chemical periodicity that the periodic table illustrates: at regular but changing intervals of atomic numbers, the properties of the chemical elements approximately repeat.The first eighteen elements can thus be arranged as the start of a periodic table.",en
3713,Elements in the same column have the same number of outer electrons and analogous outer electron configurations: these columns are called groups.,en
3714,"The single exception is helium, which has two outer electrons like beryllium and magnesium, but is placed with neon and argon to emphasise that its outer shell is full.",en
3715,"There are eight columns in this periodic table fragment, corresponding to at most eight outer electrons.",en
3716,A row begins when a new shell begins filling; these rows are called the periods.,en
3717,"Finally, the colouring illustrates the blocks: the elements in the s-block (coloured red) are filling s-orbitals, while those in the p-block (coloured yellow) are filling p-orbitals.",en
3718,"Starting the next row, for potassium and calcium the 4s orbital is the lowest in energy, and therefore they fill it.",en
3719,"Potassium adds one electron to the 4s shell ([Ar] 4s1), and calcium then completes it ([Ar] 4s2).",en
3720,"However, starting from scandium the 3d orbital becomes the next highest in energy.",en
3721,"The 4s and 3d orbitals are of approximately the same energy and they compete for filling the electrons, and so the occupation is not quite consistently filling the 3d orbitals one at a time.",en
3722,"The precise energy ordering of 3d and 4s changes along the row, and also changes depending on how many electrons are removed from the atom.",en
3723,"For example, due to the repulsion between the 3d electrons and the 4s ones, at chromium the 4s energy level becomes slightly higher than 3d, and so it becomes more profitable to have a [Ar] 3d5 4s1 configuration than an [Ar] 3d4 4s2 one.",en
3724,A similar anomaly occurs at copper.,en
3725,These are violations of the Madelung rule.,en
3726,"Such anomalies however do not have any chemical significance, as the various configurations are so close in energy to each other that the presence of a nearby atom can shift the balance.",en
3727,"The periodic table therefore ignores these and considers only idealised configurations.At zinc, the 3d orbitals are completely filled with a total of ten electrons.",en
3728,"Next come the 4p orbitals completing the row, which are filled progressively by gallium through krypton, in a manner totally analogous to the previous p-block elements.",en
3729,"From gallium onwards, the 3d orbitals form part of the electronic core, and no longer participate in chemistry.",en
3730,"The s- and p-block elements, which fill their outer shells, are called main-group elements; the d-block elements (coloured blue below), which fill an inner shell, are called transition elements (or transition metals, since they are all metals).As 5s fills before 4d, which fills before 5p, the fifth row has exactly the same structure as the fourth (though again there are some anomalies when filling the 4d orbitals).",en
3731,The sixth row of the table likewise starts with two s-block elements: caesium and barium.,en
3732,"After this, the first f-block elements (coloured green below) begin to appear, starting with lanthanum.",en
3733,These are sometimes termed inner transition elements.,en
3734,"As there are now not only 4f but also 5d and 6s subshells at similar energies, competition occurs once again with many irregular configurations; this has resulted in some dispute about where exactly the f-block is supposed to begin, but most who study the matter agree that it starts at lanthanum in accordance with the Aufbau principle.",en
3735,"Even though lanthanum does not itself fill the 4f orbital due to repulsion between electrons, its 4f orbitals are low enough in energy to participate in chemistry.",en
3736,"At ytterbium, the seven 4f orbitals are completely filled with fourteen electrons; thereafter, a series of ten transition elements (lutetium through mercury) follows, and finally six main-group elements (thallium through radon) complete the period.The seventh row is likewise analogous to the sixth row: 7s fills, then 5f, then 6d, and finally 7p, with a few anomalies along the way.",en
3737,"For a very long time, the seventh row was incomplete as most of its elements do not occur in nature.",en
3738,"The missing elements beyond uranium started to be synthesised in the laboratory in 1940, when neptunium was made.",en
3739,"The row was completed with the synthesis of tennessine in 2010 (the last element oganesson had already been made in 2002), and the last elements in this seventh row were validated and given names in 2016.",en
3740,"This completes the modern periodic table, with all seven rows completely filled to capacity.The following table shows the electron configuration of a neutral gas-phase atom of each element.",en
3741,Different configurations can be favoured in different chemical environments.,en
3742,The main-group elements have entirely regular electron configurations; the transition and inner transition elements show a number of irregularities due to the aforementioned competition between subshells close in energy level.,en
3743,"For the last ten elements (109‚Äì118), experimental data is lacking and therefore calculated configurations have been shown instead.",en
3744,Completely filled subshells have been greyed out.,en
3745," For reasons of space, the periodic table is commonly presented with the f-block elements cut out and placed as a footnote below the main body of the table, as below.",en
3746,Both forms represent the same periodic table.,en
3747,The form with the f-block included in the main body is sometimes called the 32-column or long form; the form with the f-block cut out is sometimes called the 18-column or medium-long form.,en
3748,"The 32-column form has the advantage of showing all elements in their correct sequence, but it has the disadvantage of requiring more space.All periodic tables show the elements' symbols; many also provide supplementary information about the elements, either via colour-coding or as data in the cells.",en
3749,"The above table shows the names and atomic numbers of the elements, and also their blocks, natural occurrences and standard atomic weights.",en
3750,"For the short-lived elements without standard atomic weights, the mass number of the most stable known isotope is used instead.",en
3751,"Other tables may include properties such as state of matter, melting and boiling points, densities, as well as provide different classifications of the elements.Under an international naming convention, the groups are numbered numerically from 1 to 18 from the leftmost column (the alkali metals) to the rightmost column (the noble gases).",en
3752,The f-block groups are ignored in this numbering.,en
3753,"Previously, groups were known by Roman numerals.",en
3754,"In America, the Roman numerals were followed by either an A if the group was in the s- or p-block, or a B if the group was in the d-block.",en
3755,The Roman numerals used correspond to the last digit of today's naming convention (e.g.,en
3756,"the group 4 elements were group IVB, and the group 14 elements were group IVA).",en
3757,"In Europe, the lettering was similar, except that A was used if the group was before group 10, and B was used for groups including and after group 10.",en
3758,"In addition, groups 8, 9 and 10 used to be treated as one triple-sized group, known collectively in both notations as group VIII.",en
3759,"In 1988, the new IUPAC naming system was put into use, and the old group names were deprecated.",en
3760,"As chemical reactions involve the valence electrons, elements with similar outer electron configurations may be expected to react similarly and form compounds with similar proportions of elements in them.",en
3761,"Such elements are placed in the same group, and thus there tend to be clear similarities and trends in chemical behaviour as one proceeds down a group.",en
3762,"As analogous configurations return at regular intervals, the properties of the elements thus exhibit periodic recurrences, hence the name of the periodic table and the periodic law.",en
3763,"These periodic recurrences were noticed well before the underlying theory that explains them was developed.For example, the valence of an element can be defined either as the number of hydrogen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary hydride, or as twice the number of oxygen atoms that can combine with it to form a simple binary oxide (that is, not a peroxide or a superoxide).",en
3764,"The valences of the main-group elements are directly related to the group number: the hydrides in the main groups 1‚Äì2 and 13‚Äì17 follow the formulae MH, MH2, MH3, MH4, MH3, MH2, and finally MH.",en
3765,"The highest oxides instead increase in valence, following the formulae M2O, MO, M2O3, MO2, M2O5, MO3, M2O7.",en
3766,"The electron configuration suggests a ready explanation from the number of electrons available for bonding, although a full explanation requires considering the energy that would be released in forming compounds with different valences rather than simply considering electron configurations alone.",en
3767,"Today the notion of valence has been extended by that of the oxidation state, which is the formal charge left on an element when all other elements in a compound have been removed as their ions.As elements in the same group share the same valence configurations, they usually exhibit similar chemical behaviour.",en
3768,"For example, the alkali metals in the first group all have one valence electron, and form a very homogeneous class of elements: they are all soft and reactive metals.",en
3769,"However, there are many factors involved, and groups can often be rather hetereogeneous.",en
3770,"For instance, the stable elements of group 14 comprise a nonmetal (carbon), two semiconductors (silicon and germanium), and two metals (tin and lead).",en
3771,They are nonetheless united by having four valence electrons.,en
3772,"Atomic radii (the size of atoms) generally decrease going left to right along the main-group elements, because the nuclear charge increases but the outer electrons are still in the same shell.",en
3773,"However, going down a column, the radii generally increase, because the outermost electrons are in higher shells that are thus further away from the nucleus.In the transition elements, an inner shell is filling, but the size of the atom is still determined by the outer electrons.",en
3774,"The increasing nuclear charge across the series and the increased number of inner electrons for shielding somewhat compensate each other, so the decrease in radius is smaller.",en
3775,"The 4p and 5d atoms, coming immediately after new types of transition series are first introduced, are smaller than would have been expected.",en
3776,The first ionisation energy of an atom is the energy required to remove an electron from it.,en
3777,"This varies with the atomic radius: ionisation energy increases left to right and down to up, because electrons that are closer to the nucleus are held more tightly and are more difficult to remove.",en
3778,Ionisation energy thus is minimised at the first element of each period ‚Äì hydrogen and the alkali metals ‚Äì and then generally rises until it reaches the noble gas at the right edge of the period.,en
3779,"There are some exceptions to this trend, such as oxygen, where the electron being removed is paired and thus interelectronic repulsion makes it easier to remove than expected.In the transition series, the outer electrons are preferentially lost even though the inner orbitals are filling.",en
3780,"For example, in the 3d series, the 4s electrons are lost first even though the 3d orbitals are being filled.",en
3781,"The shielding effect of adding an extra 3d electron approximately compensates the rise in nuclear charge, and therefore the ionisation energies stay mostly constant, though there is a small increase especially at the end of each transition series.As metal atoms tend to lose electrons in chemical reactions, ionisation energy is generally correlated with chemical reactivity, although there are other factors involved as well.",en
3782,"The opposite property to ionisation energy is the electron affinity, which is the energy released when adding an electron to the atom.",en
3783,"A passing electron will be more readily attracted to an atom if it feels the pull of the nucleus more strongly, and especially if there is an available partially filled outer orbital that can accommodate it.",en
3784,"Therefore, electron affinity tends to increase down to up and left to right.",en
3785,"The exception is the last column, the noble gases, which have a full shell and have no room for another electron.",en
3786,"This gives the halogens in the next-to-last column the highest electron affinities.Some atoms, like the noble gases, have no electron affinity: they cannot form stable gas-phase anions.",en
3787,"The noble gases, having high ionisation energies and no electron affinity, have little inclination towards gaining or losing electrons and are generally unreactive.Some exceptions to the trends occur: oxygen and fluorine have lower electron affinities than their heavier homologues sulfur and chlorine, because they are small atoms and hence the newly added electron would experience significant repulsion from the already present ones.",en
3788,"For the nonmetallic elements, electron affinity likewise somewhat correlates with reactivity, but not perfectly since other factors are involved.",en
3789,"For example, fluorine has a lower electron affinity than chlorine, but is more reactive.",en
3790, Another important property of elements is their electronegativity.,en
3791,"Atoms can form covalent bonds to each other by sharing electrons in pairs, creating an overlap of valence orbitals.",en
3792,The degree to which each atom attracts the shared electron pair depends on the atom's electronegativity ‚Äì the tendency of an atom towards gaining or losing electrons.,en
3793,"The more electronegative atom will tend to attract the electron pair more, and the less electronegative (or more electropositive) one will attract it less.",en
3794,"In extreme cases, the electron can be thought of as having been passed completely from the more electropositive atom to the more electronegative one, though this is a simplification.",en
3795,"The bond then binds two ions, one positive (having given up the electron) and one negative (having accepted it), and is termed an ionic bond.Electronegativity depends on how strongly the nucleus can attract an electron pair, and so it exhibits a similar variation to the other properties already discussed: electronegativity tends to fall going up to down, and rise going left to right.",en
3796,"The alkali and alkaline earth metals are among the most electropositive elements, while the chalcogens, halogens, and noble gases are among the most electronegative ones.Electronegativity is generally measured on the Pauling scale, on which the most electronegative reactive atom (fluorine) is given electronegativity 4.0, and the least electronegative atom (caesium) is given electronegativity 0.79.",en
3797,"(Theoretically neon would be more electronegative than fluorine, but the Pauling scale cannot measure its electronegativity because it does not form covalent bonds.)",en
3798,"Electronegativity of an element also somewhat depends on the identity and number of the atoms it is bonded to, as well as how many electrons it has already lost: an atom becomes more electronegative when it has lost more electrons.",en
3799,These effects leave the general trend intact.,en
3800, A simple substance is a substance formed from atoms of one chemical element.,en
3801,The simple substances of the more electronegative atoms tend to share electrons (form covalent bonds) which each other.,en
3802,"They form either small molecules (like hydrogen or oxygen, whose atoms bond in pairs) or giant structures stretching indefinitely (like carbon or silicon).",en
3803,"The noble gases simply stay as single atoms, as they already have a full shell.",en
3804,"Substances composed of discrete molecules or single atoms are held together by weaker attractive forces between the molecules, such as the London dispersion force: as electrons move within the molecules, they create momentary imbalances of electrical charge, which induce similar imbalances on nearby molecules and create synchronised movements of electrons across many neighbouring molecules.The more electropositive atoms, however, tend to instead lose electrons, creating a sea of electrons engulfing cations.",en
3805,"The outer orbitals of one atom overlap to share electrons with all its neighbours, creating a giant structure of molecular orbitals extending all over the structure.",en
3806,This negatively charged sea pulls on all the ions and keeps them together in a metallic bond.,en
3807,Elements forming such bonds are often called metals; those which do not are often called nonmetals.,en
3808,Some elements can form multiple simple substances with different structures: these are called allotropes.,en
3809,"For example, diamond and graphite are two allotropes of carbon.Due to the aforementioned trends, metals are generally found towards the left side of the periodic table, and nonmetals towards the right side.",en
3810,"Metallicity tends to be correlated with electropositivity and the willingness to lose electrons, which increases right to left and up to down; therefore, the dividing line between metals and nonmetals is roughly diagonal from top left to bottom right.",en
3811,"Most elements are metals, because the transition series appear to the left of this diagonal.",en
3812,"Elements near the borderline are difficult to classify: they tend to have properties that are intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals, and may have some properties characteristic of both.",en
3813,They are often termed semi-metals or metalloids.,en
3814,"For example, arsenic has multiple allotropes, but only one conducts electricity like a metal.",en
3815,The following table considers the most stable allotropes at standard conditions.,en
3816,The elements coloured yellow form simple substances that are well-characterised by metallic bonding.,en
3817,"Elements coloured light blue form giant covalent structures, whereas those coloured dark blue form small covalently bonded molecules that are held together by weaker van der Waals forces.",en
3818,The noble gases are coloured in violet: their molecules are single atoms and no covalent bonding occurs.,en
3819,Greyed-out cells are for elements which have not been prepared in sufficient quantities for their most stable allotropes to have been characterised in this way.,en
3820,"It is theoretically expected that most of these should be metals, and there is some indirect experimental evidence that this is true for fermium and mendelevium, but some question remains for copernicium and oganesson where theoretical models do not agree.",en
3821,"Generally, metals are shiny and dense.",en
3822,"They usually have high melting and boiling points due to the strength of the metallic bond, and are malleable and ductile (easily stretched and shaped) because the atoms can move relative to each other without breaking the metallic bond.",en
3823,They conduct electricity because their electrons are free to move in all three dimensions.,en
3824,"Similarly, they conduct heat, which is transferred by the electrons as extra kinetic energy: they move faster.",en
3825,"These properties persist in the liquid state, as although the crystal structure is destroyed on melting, the atoms still touch and the metallic bond persists, though it is weakened.",en
3826,Metals tend to be reactive towards nonmetals.Nonmetals exhibit different properties.,en
3827,"Those forming giant covalent crystals exhibit high melting and boiling points, as it takes a lot of energy to overcome the strong covalent bonds.",en
3828,"Those forming discrete molecules are held together mostly by dispersion forces, which are more easily overcame; thus they tend to have lower melting and boiling points, and many are liquids or gases at room temperature.",en
3829,Nonmetals are often dull-looking.,en
3830,"They tend to be reactive towards metals, except for the noble gases, which are inert towards most substances.",en
3831,They are brittle when solid as their atoms are held tightly in place.,en
3832,"They are less dense and conduct electricity poorly, because there are no mobile electrons; the orbitals that overlap and would allow the electrons to move freely are too high in energy to reach.",en
3833,"However, especially near the borderline, this energy gap is small and electrons can readily cross it when thermally excited.",en
3834,"Hence, many elements near the borderline are semiconductors, such as silicon, germanium, selenium in its gray allotrope, and tellurium.As such, it is common to designate a class of metalloids straddling the boundary between metals and nonmetals, as elements in that region are intermediate in both physical and chemical properties.",en
3835,"However, no consensus exists in the literature for precisely which elements should be so designated.",en
3836,"When such a category is used, boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium are usually included; but most sources include other elements as well, without agreement on which extra elements should be added, and some others subtract from this list instead.",en
3837,"For example, the periodic table used by the American Chemical Society includes polonium as a metalloid, but that used by the Royal Society of Chemistry does not, and that included in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica does not refer to metalloids or semi-metals at all.",en
3838," There are some other relationships throughout the periodic table between elements that are not in the same group, such as the diagonal relationships between elements that are diagonally adjacent (e.g.",en
3839,lithium and magnesium).,en
3840,"Some similarities can also be found between the main groups and the transition metal groups, or between the early actinides and early transition metals, when the elements have the same number of valence electrons.",en
3841,"Thus uranium somewhat resembles chromium and tungsten in group 6, as all three have six valence electrons.The first row of every block tends to show rather distinct properties from the other rows, because the first orbital of each type (1s, 2p, 3d, 4f, 5g, etc.)",en

3843,"The degree of the anomaly is highest for the s-block, is moderate for the p-block, and is less pronounced for the d- and f-blocks.",en
3844,"There is also an even-odd difference between the periods (except in the s-block) that is sometimes known as secondary periodicity: elements in even periods have smaller atomic radii and prefer to lose fewer electrons, while elements in odd periods (except the first) differ in the opposite direction.",en
3845,"Thus, many properties in the p-block show a zigzag rather than a smooth trend along the group.",en

3847,"When atomic nuclei become highly charged, special relativity becomes needed to gauge the effect of the nucleus on the electron cloud.",en

3884,"In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death.",en
3885,The definitive breakthrough came from the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.,en

3892,"Mendeleev predicted the properties of three of these unknown elements in detail: as they would be missing heavier homologues of boron, aluminium, and silicon, he named them eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicon (eka being Sanskrit for one).",en
3893,":‚Ää45‚ÄäIn 1875, the French chemist Paul-√âmile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, working without knowledge of Mendeleev's prediction, discovered a new element in a sample of the mineral sphalerite, and named it gallium.",en
3894,He isolated the element and began determining its properties.,en

3898,"Eka-silicon was found in 1886 by German chemist Clemens Winkler, who named it germanium.",en
3899,"The properties of gallium, scandium, and germanium matched what Mendeleev had predicted.",en

3901,"Even the discovery of the noble gases at the close of the 19th century, which Mendeleev had not predicted, fitted neatly into his scheme as an eighth main group.",en
3902,"However, Mendeleev had some trouble fitting the known lanthanides into his scheme, as they did not exhibit the periodic change in valencies that the other elements did.",en
3903,"After much investigation, the Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner suggested in 1902 that the lanthanides could all be placed together in one group on the periodic table.",en
3904,"He named this the asteroid hypothesis as an astronomical analogy: just as there is an asteroid belt instead of a single planet between Mars and Jupiter, so the place below yttrium was occupied by all the lanthanides instead of just one element.",en
3905,"After the internal structure of the atom was probed, amateur Dutch physicist Antonius van den Broek proposed in 1913 that the nuclear charge determined the placement of elements in the periodic table.",en
3906,The New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford coined the word atomic number for this nuclear charge.,en
3907,In van der Broek's published article he illustrated the first electronic periodic table showing the elements arranged according to the number of their electrons.,en
3908,Rutherford confirmed in his 1914 paper that Bohr had accepted the view of van der Broek.,en
3909,"The same year, English physicist Henry Moseley using X-ray spectroscopy confirmed van den Broek's proposal experimentally.",en
3910,Moseley determined the value of the nuclear charge of each element from aluminium to gold and showed that Mendeleev's ordering actually places the elements in sequential order by nuclear charge.,en
3911,Nuclear charge is identical to proton count and determines the value of the atomic number (Z) of each element.,en
3912,"Using atomic number gives a definitive, integer-based sequence for the elements.",en
3913,"Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties; these were cases such as tellurium and iodine, where atomic number increases but atomic weight decreases.",en
3914,"Although Moseley was soon killed in World War I, the Swedish physicist Manne Siegbahn continued his work up to uranium, and established that it was the element with the highest atomic number then known (92).",en
3915,"Based on Moseley and Siegbahn's research, it was also known which atomic numbers corresponded to missing elements yet to be found.The Danish physicist Niels Bohr applied Max Planck's idea of quantisation to the atom.",en
3916,He concluded that the energy levels of electrons were quantised: only a discrete set of stable energy states were allowed.,en
3917,"Bohr then attempted to understand periodicity through electron configurations, surmising in 1913 that the inner electrons should be responsible for the chemical properties of the element.",en
3918,"In 1913, he produced the first electronic periodic table based on a quantum atom.Bohr called his electron shells rings in 1913: atomic orbitals within shells did not exist at the time of his planetary model.",en
3919,"Bohr explains in Part 3 of his famous 1913 paper that the maximum electrons in a shell is eight, writing, We see, further, that a ring of n electrons cannot rotate in a single ring round a nucleus of charge ne unless n < 8.",en
3920,"For smaller atoms, the electron shells would be filled as follows: rings of electrons will only join together if they contain equal numbers of electrons; and that accordingly the numbers of electrons on inner rings will only be 2, 4, 8.",en
3921,"However, in larger atoms the innermost shell would contain eight electrons: on the other hand, the periodic system of the elements strongly suggests that already in neon N = 10 an inner ring of eight electrons will occur.",en
3922,His proposed electron configurations for the light atoms (shown to the right) do not always accord with those now known.,en
3923,The first one to systematically expand and correct the chemical potentials of Bohr's atomic theory was Walther Kossel in 1914 and in 1916.,en
3924,Kossel explained that in the periodic table new elements would be created as electrons were added to the outer shell.,en
3925,"In Kossel's paper, he writes: This leads to the conclusion that the electrons, which are added further, should be put into concentric rings or shells, on each of which ... only a certain number of electrons‚Äînamely, eight in our case‚Äîshould be arranged.",en
3926,"As soon as one ring or shell is completed, a new one has to be started for the next element; the number of electrons, which are most easily accessible, and lie at the outermost periphery, increases again from element to element and, therefore, in the formation of each new shell the chemical periodicity is repeated.",en
3927,"In a 1919 paper, Irving Langmuir postulated the existence of cells which we now call orbitals, which could each only contain two electrons each, and these were arranged in equidistant layers which we now call shells.",en
3928,He made an exception for the first shell to only contain two electrons.,en
3929,The chemist Charles Rugeley Bury suggested in 1921 that eight and eighteen electrons in a shell form stable configurations.,en
3930,Bury proposed that the electron configurations in transitional elements depended upon the valence electrons in their outer shell.,en
3931,He introduced the word transition to describe the elements now known as transition metals or transition elements.,en
3932,"The quantum theory clarified the transition metals and lanthanides as forming their own separate groups, transitional between the main groups, although some chemists had already proposed tables showing them this way before then: the English chemist Henry Bassett did so in 1892, the Danish chemist Julius Thomsen in 1895, and the Swiss chemist Alfred Werner in 1905.",en
3933,"Bohr used Thomsen's form in his 1922 Nobel Lecture; Werner's form is very similar to the modern 32-column form.Prompted by Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli took up the problem of electron configurations in 1923.",en
3934,"Pauli extended Bohr's scheme to use four quantum numbers, and formulated his exclusion principle which stated that no two electrons could have the same four quantum numbers.",en
3935,"This explained the lengths of the periods in the periodic table (2, 8, 18, and 32), which corresponded to the number of electrons that each shell could occupy.",en
3936,"In 1925, Friedrich Hund arrived at configurations close to the modern ones.",en
3937,The Aufbau principle that describes the electron configurations of the elements was first empirically observed by Erwin Madelung in 1926 and published in 1936.,en
3938,"By then, the pool of missing elements from hydrogen to uranium had shrunk to four: elements 43, 61, 85, and 87 remained missing.",en
3939,Element 43 eventually became the first element to be synthesised artificially via nuclear reactions rather than discovered in nature.,en
3940,"It was discovered in 1937 by Italian chemists Emilio Segr√® and Carlo Perrier, who named their discovery technetium, after the Greek word for artificial.",en
3941,"Elements 61 (promethium) and 85 (astatine) were likewise produced artificially; element 87 (francium) became the last element to be discovered in nature, by French chemist Marguerite Perey.",en
3942,"The elements beyond uranium were likewise discovered artificially, starting with Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson's 1940 discovery of neptunium.",en
3943,"Glenn T. Seaborg and his team continued discovering transuranium elements, starting with plutonium, and discovered that contrary to previous thinking, the elements from actinium onwards were f-block congeners of the lanthanides rather than d-block transition metals.",en
3944,"Bassett (1892), Werner (1905), and the French engineer Charles Janet (1928) had previously suggested this, but their ideas did not then receive general acceptance.",en
3945,"Seaborg thus called them the actinides.A significant controversy arose with elements 102 through 106 in the 1960s and 1970s, as competition arose between a team of American scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and a team of Soviet scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR).",en
3946,"Each team claimed discovery, and in some cases each proposed their own name for the element, creating an element naming controversy that lasted decades.",en
3947,"IUPAC at first adopted a hands-off approach, preferring to wait and see if a consensus would be forthcoming.",en
3948,"Unfortunately, it was also the height of the Cold War, and it became clear after some time that this would not happen.",en
3949,"As such, IUPAC and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) created a Transfermium Working Group (TWG, fermium being element 100) in 1985 to set out criteria for discovery.",en
3950,"After some further controversy, these elements received their final names in 1997.The TWG's criteria were used to arbitrate later element discovery claims from research institutes in Germany, Russia, and Japan.",en
3951,"Currently, consideration of discovery claims is performed by a IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party.",en
3952,"After priority was assigned, the elements were officially added to the periodic table, and the discoverers were invited to propose their names.",en
3953,"By 2016, this had occurred for all elements up to 118, therefore completing the periodic table's first seven rows.In celebration of the periodic table's 150th anniversary, the United Nations declared the year 2019 as the International Year of the Periodic Table, celebrating one of the most significant achievements in science.",en
3954,"Today, the periodic table is among the most recognisable icons of chemistry.",en
3955,"IUPAC is involved today with many processes relating to the periodic table: the recognition and naming of new elements, recommending group numbers and collective names, determining which elements belong to group 3, and the updating of atomic weights.",en
3956," Although the modern periodic table is standard today, some variation can be found in period 1 and group 3.",en
3957,Discussion is ongoing about the placements ofthe relevant elements.,en
3958,"The controversy has to do with conflicting understandings of whether chemical or electronic properties should primarily decide periodic table placement, and conflicting views of how the evidence should be used.",en
3959,"A similar potential problem has been raised by theoretical investigations of the superheavy elements, whose chemistries may not fit their present position on the periodic table.",en
3960,"Usually, hydrogen is placed in group 1, and helium in group 18: this is the placement found on the IUPAC periodic table.",en
3961,"Some variation can be found on both these matters.Like the group 1 metals, hydrogen has one electron in its outermost shell and typically loses its only electron in chemical reactions.",en
3962,"It has some metal-like chemical properties, being able to displace some metals from their salts.",en
3963,"But hydrogen forms a diatomic nonmetallic gas at standard conditions, unlike the alkali metals which are reactive solid metals.",en
3964,"This and hydrogen's formation of hydrides, in which it gains an electron, brings it close to the properties of the halogens which do the same.",en
3965,"Moreover, the lightest two halogens (fluorine and chlorine) are gaseous like hydrogen at standard conditions.",en
3966,"Hydrogen thus has properties corresponding to both those of the alkali metals and the halogens, but matches neither group perfectly, and is thus difficult to place by its chemistry.",en
3967,"Therefore, while the electronic placement of hydrogen in group 1 predominates, some rarer arrangements show either hydrogen in group 17, duplicate hydrogen in both groups 1 and 17, or float it separately from all groups.Helium is an unreactive noble gas at standard conditions, and has a full outer shell: these properties are like the noble gases in group 18, but not at all like the reactive alkaline earth metals of group 2.",en
3968,"Therefore, helium is nearly universally placed in group 18 which its properties best match.",en
3969,"However, helium only has two outer electrons in its outer shell, whereas the other noble gases have eight; and it is an s-block element, whereas all other noble gases are p-block elements.",en
3970,"Also, solid helium crystallises in a hexagonal close-packed structure, which matches beryllium and magnesium in group 2, but not the other noble gases in group 18.",en
3971,In these ways helium better matches the alkaline earth metals.,en
3972,"Therefore, tables with both hydrogen and helium floating outside all groups may rarely be encountered.",en
3973,A few chemists have advocated that the electronic placement in group 2 be adopted for helium.,en
3974,"Arguments for this often rest on the first-row anomaly trend, as helium as the first s2 element before the alkaline earth metals stands out as anomalous in a way that helium as the first noble gas does not.",en
3975,"Published periodic tables show variation regarding the heavier members of group 3, which begins with scandium and yttrium.",en
3976,"They are most commonly lanthanum and actinium, but there are many physical and chemical arguments that they should instead be lutetium and lawrencium.",en
3977,"A compromise can also sometimes be found, in which the spaces below yttrium are left blank.",en
3978,"This leaves it ambiguous if the group only contains scandium and yttrium, or if it also extends to include all thirty lanthanides and actinides.",en
3979,"Based on the electron configurations that were known at the time, lanthanum was initially placed as the first of the 5d elements as it added a d-electron to the preceding element, barium.",en
3980,"This made it the third member of group 3, with cerium to lutetium then following as the f-block, which then split the d-block in two.",en
3981,"But in 1937, it was found that the 4f subshell completed filling at ytterbium rather than at lutetium as had previously been thought.",en
3982,"As such, in 1948 the Soviet physicists Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz pointed out in their Course of Theoretical Physics that the new configurations suggested that the first 5d element was lutetium and not lanthanum.",en
3983,This avoids the d-block split by letting the f-block precede the d-block in accordance with the Aufbau principle.,en
3984,Such a placement had previously been adopted by Werner in 1905 (though lutetium had not yet been discovered) and by Janet in 1928.,en
3985,"Several physicists and chemists in the following decades supported this reassignment based on other physical and chemical properties of the elements involved, although this evidence has in turn been criticised as having been selectively chosen.",en
3986,"Most authors did not make the change.In 1988, a IUPAC report was published that touched on the matter.",en
3987,"While it wrote that electron configurations were in favour of the new assignment of group 3 with lutetium and lawrencium, it instead decided on a compromise where the lower spots in group 3 were instead left blank, because the traditional form with lanthanum and actinium remained popular.",en
3988,"This is similar to Brauner's 1902 asteroid hypothesis; it makes the f-block appear with 15 elements despite quantum mechanics dictating that it should have 14, and leaves it unclear if group 3 contains only scandium and yttrium, or if it contains all lanthanides and actinides in addition.The IUPAC compromise did not stop the debate.",en
3989,"Most sources focusing on the question supported the reassignment, but some authors argued instead in favour of the traditional form with lanthanum as the first 5d element, sometimes giving rise to furious debate.",en
3990,"A minority of textbooks accepted the reassignment, but most either showed the older form or the IUPAC compromise.In 2015 IUPAC began a project to decide whether lanthanum or lutetium should go in group 3, chaired by Eric Scerri, a chemist and philosopher of science of Maltese origin.",en
3991,"It considered the question to be of considerable importance for chemists, physicists, and students, noting that the variation in published periodic tables on this point typically puzzled students and instructors.",en
3992,"A provisional report appeared from it in 2021, which was in favour of lutetium as the first 5d element.",en
3993,"The reasons given were to display all elements in order of increasing atomic number, avoid the d-block split, and to have the blocks follow the widths quantum mechanics demands of them (2, 6, 10, and 14).",en
3994,The project ended that year.,en
3995,"Currently, IUPAC's website on the periodic table still shows the 1988 compromise, but mentions the group 3 problem and project to resolve it, and writes Stay tune[d].",en
3996," Although all elements up to oganesson (element 118) have been discovered, the chemistry of the elements beyond hassium (element 108) is not well-understood.",en
3997,"Of these, only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have been experimentally investigated; these investigations so far have not produced conclusive results.Some of the elements past hassium may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects.",en
3998,"For example, extrapolation would suggest that copernicium and flerovium behave as metals, like their respective lighter congeners mercury and lead.",en
3999,"However, they have been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, even though neither is placed in group 18 with the other noble gases.",en
4000,The current experimental evidence still leaves open the question of whether or not this is the case.,en
4001,"At the same time, oganesson (element 118) is expected to be a solid semiconductor at standard conditions, similar to silicon in group 14, despite being in group 18.",en
4002,"Tennessine (element 117), at the bottom of the halogen group, is expected to be a rather volatile metal with similarities to gallium in group 13; while nihonium, which is actually in group 13, should have similarities to the halogen astatine.Some scientists have argued that should these superheavy elements truly have different properties than their position on the periodic table suggests, the periodic table should be altered to place them with more chemically similar elements.",en
4003,"On the other hand, others have argued that the periodic table should reflect atomic structure rather than chemical properties, and oppose such a change.",en
4004,"The most recently named elements ‚Äì nihonium (113), moscovium (115), tennessine (117), and oganesson (118) ‚Äì completed the seventh row of the periodic table.",en
4005,Future elements would have to begin an eighth row.,en
4006,These elements may be referred to either by their atomic numbers (e.g.,en
4007,"element 119), or by the IUPAC systematic element names which directly relate to the atomic numbers.",en
4008,All attempts to synthesise such elements have failed so far.,en
4009,An attempt to make element 119 has been ongoing since 2018 at the Riken research institute in Japan.,en
4010,"The Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia also plans to make its own attempts at synthesising the first few period 8 elements.Currently, discussion continues if this future eighth period should follow the pattern set by the earlier periods or not, as calculations predict that by this point relativistic effects should result in significant deviations from the Madelung rule.",en
4011,Various different models have been suggested.,en
4012,"All agree that the eighth period should begin like the previous ones with two 8s elements, and that there should then follow a new series of g-block elements filling up the 5g orbitals, but the precise configurations calculated for these 5g elements vary widely between sources.",en
4013,"Beyond this 5g series, calculations do not agree on what exactly should follow.",en
4014,"Filling of the 5g, 6f, 7d, and 8p shells is expected to occur in approximately that order, but they are likely to be intermingled with each other and with the 9s and 9p subshells, so that it is not clear which elements should go in which groups anymore.",en
4015,"Scerri has raised the question of whether an extended periodic table should take into account the failure of the Madelung rule in this region, or if such exceptions should be ignored.",en
4016,"The shell structure may also be fairly formal at this point: already the electron distribution in an oganesson atom is expected to be rather uniform, with no discernible shell structure.Nuclear stability will likely prove a decisive factor constraining the number of possible elements.",en
4017,It depends on the balance between the electric repulsion between protons and the strong force binding protons and neutrons together.,en
4018,"Protons and neutrons are arranged in shells, just like electrons, and so a closed shell can significantly increase stability: the known superheavy nuclei exist because of such a shell closure.",en
4019,"They are probably close to a predicted island of stability, where superheavy nuclides should have significantly longer half-lives: predictions range from minutes or days, to millions or billions of years.",en
4020,"However, as the number of protons increases beyond about 126, this stabilising effect should vanish as a closed shell is passed.",en
4021,"It is not clear if any further-out shell closures exist, due to an expected smearing out of distinct nuclear shells (as is already expected for the electron shells at oganesson).",en
4022,"Furthermore, even if later shell closures exist, it is not clear if they would allow such heavy elements to exist.",en
4023,"Alternatively, quark matter may become stable at high mass numbers, in which the nucleus is composed of freely flowing up and down quarks instead of binding them into protons and neutrons; this would create a continent of stability instead of an island.",en
4024,"Other effects may come into play: for example, in very heavy elements the 1s electrons are likely to spend a significant amount of time so close to the nucleus that they are actually inside it, which would make them vulnerable to electron capture.Even if eighth-row elements can exist, producing them is likely to be difficult, and it should become even more difficult as atomic number rises.",en
4025,"Although the 8s elements are expected to be reachable with present means, the first few 5g elements are expected to require new technology, if they can be produced at all.",en

5049,Rice was chosen as a model organism for the biology of grasses because of its relatively small genome (~430 megabase pairs).,en
5050,"Rice was the first crop with a complete genome sequence.On December 16, 2002, the UN General Assembly declared the year 2004 the International Year of Rice.",en
5051,The declaration was sponsored by more than 40 countries.,en
5052,Varietal development has ceremonial and historical significance for some cultures (see ¬ß Culture below).,en
5053,"The Thai kings have patronised rice breeding since at least the reign of Chulalongkorn, and his great-great-grandson Vajiralongkorn released five particular rice varieties to celebrate his coronation.",en
5054,The high-yielding varieties are a group of crops created intentionally during the Green Revolution to increase global food production.,en
5055,"This project enabled labor markets in Asia to shift away from agriculture, and into industrial sectors.",en
5056,"The first Rice Car, IR8 was produced in 1966 at the International Rice Research Institute which is based in the Philippines at the University of the Philippines' Los Ba√±os site.",en
5057,"IR8 was created through a cross between an Indonesian variety named Peta and a Chinese variety named Dee Geo Woo Gen.Scientists have identified and cloned many genes involved in the gibberellin signaling pathway, including GAI1 (Gibberellin Insensitive) and SLR1 (Slender Rice).",en
5058,Disruption of gibberellin signaling can lead to significantly reduced stem growth leading to a dwarf phenotype.,en
5059,Photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically.,en
5060,"Assimilates become redirected to grain production, amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield.",en
5061,"In the presence of nitrogen fertilizers, and intensive crop management, these varieties increase their yield two to three times.",en
5062," As the UN Millennium Development project seeks to spread global economic development to Africa, the Green Revolution is cited as the model for economic development.",en
5063,"With the intent of replicating the successful Asian boom in agronomic productivity, groups like the Earth Institute are doing research on African agricultural systems, hoping to increase productivity.",en
5064,An important way this can happen is the production of New Rices for Africa (NERICA).,en
5065,"These rices, selected to tolerate the low input and harsh growing conditions of African agriculture, are produced by the African Rice Center, and billed as technology from Africa, for Africa.",en
5066,"The NERICA have appeared in The New York Times (October 10, 2007) and International Herald Tribune (October 9, 2007), trumpeted as miracle crops that will dramatically increase rice yield in Africa and enable an economic resurgence.",en
5067,Ongoing research in China to develop perennial rice could result in enhanced sustainability and food security.,en
5068,"Ventria Bioscience has genetically modified rice to express lactoferrin, lysozyme which are proteins usually found in breast milk, and human serum albumin, These proteins have antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects.Rice containing these added proteins can be used as a component in oral rehydration solutions which are used to treat diarrheal diseases, thereby shortening their duration and reducing recurrence.",en
5069,Such supplements may also help reverse anemia.,en
5070,"Due to the varying levels that water can reach in regions of cultivation, flood tolerant varieties have long been developed and used.",en
5071,"Flooding is an issue that many rice growers face, especially in South and South East Asia where flooding annually affects 20 million hectares (49 million acres).",en
5072,"Standard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding of more than about a week, mainly as it disallows the plant access to necessary requirements such as sunlight and essential gas exchanges, inevitably leading to plants being unable to recover.",en
5073,"In the past, this has led to massive losses in yields, such as in the Philippines, where in 2006, rice crops worth $65 million were lost to flooding.",en
5074,Recently developed cultivars seek to improve flood tolerance.,en
5075," Drought represents a significant environmental stress for rice production, with 19‚Äì23 million hectares (47‚Äì57 million acres) of rainfed rice production in South and South East Asia often at risk.",en
5076,"Under drought conditions, without sufficient water to afford them the ability to obtain the required levels of nutrients from the soil, conventional commercial rice varieties can be severely affected‚Äîfor example, yield losses as high as 40% have affected some parts of India, with resulting losses of around US$800 million annually.The International Rice Research Institute conducts research into developing drought-tolerant rice varieties, including the varieties 5411 and Sookha dhan, currently being employed by farmers in the Philippines and Nepal respectively.",en
5077,"In addition, in 2013 the Japanese National Institute for Agrobiological Sciences led a team which successfully inserted the DEEPER ROOTING 1 (DRO1) gene, from the Philippine upland rice variety Kinandang Patong, into the popular commercial rice variety IR64, giving rise to a far deeper root system in the resulting plants.",en
5078,"This facilitates an improved ability for the rice plant to derive its required nutrients in times of drought via accessing deeper layers of soil, a feature demonstrated by trials which saw the IR64 + DRO1 rice yields drop by 10% under moderate drought conditions, compared to 60% for the unmodified IR64 variety.",en
5079,"Soil salinity poses a major threat to rice crop productivity, particularly along low-lying coastal areas during the dry season.",en
5080,"For example, roughly 1 million hectares (2.5 million acres) of the coastal areas of Bangladesh are affected by saline soils.",en
5081,"These high concentrations of salt can severely affect rice plants' normal physiology, especially during early stages of growth, and as such farmers are often forced to abandon these otherwise potentially usable areas.Progress has been made, however, in developing rice varieties capable of tolerating such conditions; the hybrid created from the cross between the commercial rice variety IR56 and the wild rice species Oryza coarctata is one example.",en
5082,"O. coarctata is capable of successful growth in soils with double the limit of salinity of normal varieties, but lacks the ability to produce edible rice.",en
5083,"Developed by the International Rice Research Institute, the hybrid variety can utilise specialised leaf glands that allow for the removal of salt into the atmosphere.",en
5084,"It was initially produced from one successful embryo out of 34,000 crosses between the two species; this was then backcrossed to IR56 with the aim of preserving the genes responsible for salt tolerance that were inherited from O. coarctata.",en
5085,Extensive trials are planned prior to the new variety being available to farmers by approximately 2017‚Äì18.,en
5086,When the problem of soil salinity arises it will be opportune to select salt tolerant varieties (IRRI or to resort to soil salinity control.,en
5087,Soil salinity is often measured as the electric conductivity (EC) of the extract of a saturated soil paste (ECe).,en
5088,The EC units are usually expressed in decisiemens per metre or dS/m.,en
5089,"The critical ECe value of 5.5 dS/m in the figure, obtained from measurements in farmers' fields, indicates that the rice crop is slightly salt sensitive.",en
5090, Producing rice in paddies is harmful for the environment due to the release of methane by methanogenic bacteria.,en
5091,"These bacteria live in the anaerobic waterlogged soil, and live off nutrients released by rice roots.",en
5092,"Researchers have recently reported in Nature that putting the barley gene SUSIBA2 into rice creates a shift in biomass production from root to shoot (above ground tissue becomes larger, while below ground tissue is reduced), decreasing the methanogen population, and resulting in a reduction of methane emissions of up to 97%.",en
5093,"Apart from this environmental benefit, the modification also increases the amount of rice grains by 43%, which makes it a useful tool in feeding a growing world population.",en
5094, Rice is used as a model organism for investigating the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and DNA repair in higher plants.,en
5095,Meiosis is a key stage of the sexual cycle in which diploid cells in the ovule (female structure) and the anther (male structure) produce haploid cells that develop further into gametophytes and gametes.,en
5096,"So far, 28 meiotic genes of rice have been characterized.",en
5097,"Studies of rice gene OsRAD51C showed that this gene is necessary for homologous recombinational repair of DNA, particularly the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis.",en

5102,"Most rituals involving Dewi Sri are associated with the mythical origin attributed to the rice plant, the staple food of the region.",en
5103,"In Thailand, a similar rice deity is known as Phosop; she is a deity more related to ancient local folklore than a goddess of a structured, mainstream religion.",en
5104,The same female rice deity is known as Po Ino Nogar in Cambodia and as Nang Khosop in Laos.,en
5105,Ritual offerings are made during the different stages of rice production to propitiate the Rice Goddess in the corresponding cultures.,en
5106,"A 2014 study of Han Chinese communities found that a history of farming rice makes cultures more psychologically interdependent, whereas a history of farming wheat makes cultures more independent.A Royal Ploughing Ceremony is held in certain Asian countries to mark the beginning of the rice planting season.",en
